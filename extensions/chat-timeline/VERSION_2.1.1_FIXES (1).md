## 🎯 **WHAT TO CHECK**

### **On ChatGPT:**

- [ ] Text looks crisp and clear
- [ ] Colors match ChatGPT's green theme

### **On Claude:**

## 🐛 **IF IT STILL DOESN'T WORK ON CHATGPT**

Open browser console (F12) and look for:
```
[Timeline] Initializing for platform: chatgpt
[Timeline] Found ChatGPT sidebar: [selector name]
```

If you see "No sidebar found", send me a screenshot and I'll add more selectors.

## 💎 **TEXT RENDERING IMPROVEMENTS**

### **Before:**
```css
font-weight: 500;
/* No antialiasing */
/* No letter spacing */
```

### **After:**
```css
font-weight: 600;
-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
-moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;
letter-spacing: -0.01em;
```

**Result:** Text looks like it's part of ChatGPT/Claude's native UI
