- Lower eye strain (better UX)
- Brand alignment
- Light mode still supported

### Why Zero Dependencies?
- Faster loading (no build step needed)
- Easier to customize
- Better performance
- Simpler maintenance

### Why 256 + 302 + 307 Lines?
- Focused on essentials only
- No bloat
- Easier to understand
- Fast to load (~400ms first paint)

### Why WCAG 2.1 AA?
- Industry standard

## ✨ What Makes This Different

### Standard AI Chat UIs Have:
- Cluttered sidebars with metrics
- System info noise on screen
- No learning/coaching
- Generic design

### TooLoo Modern UI Has:
- **Purposeful sidebars** (segmentation + coaching)
- **Zero clutter** (admin controls hidden)
- **Unique coaching system** (real-time recommendations)
- **Professional design** (industry-standard quality)
- **All TooLoo magic preserved** (hierarchy, tracking, etc.)

---

## 🔗 API Integration Points

These 5 endpoints power the new UI:

1. **POST `/api/v1/chat/message`** - Send message to AI
2. **GET `/api/v1/conversation/history`** - Load conversation
3. **POST `/api/v1/segmentation/analyze`** - Get segments
4. **POST `/api/v1/coaching/recommendations`** - Get coaching
5. **GET `/api/v1/system/status`** - Get system status (optional)

Full payloads documented in `UI_REDESIGN_GUIDE.md`.

## 📱 Responsive Behavior

```
Desktop (1024px+)
├─ Two columns visible
├─ Sidebar always shown
└─ All features enabled

Tablet (768px - 1023px)
├─ Sidebar adapts
├─ Chat takes more space
└─ Touch-friendly

Mobile (< 768px)
├─ Single column
├─ Sidebar hidden (swipe/tab)
├─ Full-width chat
└─ Touch targets ≥48px
```
