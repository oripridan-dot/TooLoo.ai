# ü§ñ TooLoo AI Chat - Now Powered by Real Language Models

## Overview

TooLoo Chat has evolved from simple command parsing to **genuine AI coaching**. Your AI coach reads your real learning data and provides personalized, intelligent guidance.

---

## Two Modes

### üß† Mode 1: Full AI (With API Key)

When Claude or GitHub models are configured:
- **Real reasoning** about your learning challenges
- **Personalized advice** based on your mastery profile
- **Educational psychology** principles integrated
- **Natural conversation** like talking to ChatGPT/Claude

Example:
```
You: "Why is distributed systems so hard for me?"

AI Coach: "Great question. Looking at your profile, 
you're actually quite strong in Security (100%) which 
shares fundamental concepts with distributed systems. 
The challenge with DS is typically the 
**coordination complexity** and **concurrency concepts**. 
Here's what I recommend based on your strengths..."
```

### ‚ö° Mode 2: Intelligent Fallback (Default)

Without an API key, uses smart pattern matching with real integration:
- Detects intent (coaching, status, domain focus)
- Fetches real-time data from your 9 domains
- Executes actual coaching via Coach Server
- Still connects all 11 TooLoo services

Example:
```
You: "I need help with distributed systems"
‚Üí System detects: domain focus request
‚Üí Fetches your mastery: 79% in DS
‚Üí Executes 10-round focused coaching
‚Üí Returns: "‚úÖ Focused Training on Distributed Systems"
```

## Unlocking Full AI

### Option A: Claude (Recommended)

**Cost:** ~$0.01/chat (uses budget Haiku model)

1. Get API key: https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Export: `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-v0-xxxxx"`
3. Restart: `node servers/web-server.js`
4. Now uses real Claude reasoning!

### Option B: GitHub Models (Free)

**Cost:** Free (GitHub-hosted models)

1. Get token: https://github.com/settings/tokens (create with `read:packages`)
2. Export: `export GITHUB_TOKEN="github_pat_xxxxx"`
3. Restart: `node servers/web-server.js`
4. Uses GPT-4o mini for free!

### Option C: Both (Maximum Coverage)

System tries in order:
1. ‚úì Claude (recommended for quality)
2. ‚úì GitHub Models (backup)
3. ‚úì Smart fallback (always works)

## Use Cases

### Student Struggling with Topic
```
You: "Distributed systems is so confusing. Where do I even start?"

AI (with Claude):
"I see you're at 79% in DS‚Äîyou're close! The confusion often 
comes from needing to think in terms of *multiple machines 
thinking at once*. Since you're strong in Security (100%), 
think of it as: distributed systems = security problems √ó 
coordination problems. Let me coach you on the coordination 
aspects. You ready?"

Fallback (no key):
"‚ö†Ô∏è Areas to Improve: Distributed Systems (79%)
‚úÖ Focused Training: 10 rounds on Distributed Systems
Sticky Batch Mode: ON"
```

### Fast Learner Wanting Challenge
```
You: "I'm breezing through these topics. Can I get harder material?"

AI (with Claude):
"You're at 84% average‚Äîready for advanced synthesis. Since 
Security is your strength (100%), let's build distributed systems 
knowledge by exploring security-relevant DS patterns like Byzantine 
Fault Tolerance. This bridges your expertise. Fast coaching?"

Fallback:
"Coaching Session Complete
Rounds: 20 (accelerated mode)
Topics: Distributed Systems"
```

### Transfer Learning Question
```
You: "How can I use what I learned in Security here?"

AI (with Claude):
"Excellent instinct! Your Security knowledge includes cryptographic 
primitives, authentication, and integrity checks. DS applies these 
when:
1. Validating messages between nodes ‚Üí Authentication
2. Ensuring data consistency ‚Üí Integrity checks
3. Preventing malicious nodes ‚Üí Cryptographic signatures

Here's a focused session connecting these..."

Fallback:
"‚ö†Ô∏è Security (100%) ‚Üí Distributed Systems (79%)
‚úÖ Focused Training: 10 rounds on Distributed Systems"
```
