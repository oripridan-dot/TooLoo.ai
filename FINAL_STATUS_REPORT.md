## 🔧 How It Works (Architecture)

### Intelligent Routing Flow

```
User Message
    ↓
Detect Task Type (keyword matching)
    ↓
Choose Best Provider
    ├─ Reasoning? → Claude Haiku 4.5
    ├─ Coding? → Claude Haiku 4.5
    ├─ Creative? → (OpenAI) → fallback Claude
    ├─ Analysis? → (DeepSeek) → fallback Claude
    └─ General? → Claude Haiku 4.5
    ↓
Call Provider API (connection pooled, max 512 tokens)
    ↓
If Error → Fallback to Next Provider
    ↓
Stream Response to UI (~2-3 seconds)
    ↓
User sees answer
```

### Provider Priority
1. **Claude Haiku 4.5** (default, fastest)
2. **OpenAI GPT-4** (backup for creative)
3. **DeepSeek** (backup for analysis)
4. **Ollama Local** (if APIs all fail)
