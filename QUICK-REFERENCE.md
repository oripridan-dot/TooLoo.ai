## 📸 Visual Context Workflow

### Old Way (Painful):
```
You: "The login button isn't working"
Me: "Which file? Can you navigate to it?"
You: *searches through folders, eye strain*
```

### New Way (Effortless):
```
1. Cmd+Shift+S (screenshot)
2. Paste in chat
3. "This button isn't working"
4. I see exactly what you see
```
