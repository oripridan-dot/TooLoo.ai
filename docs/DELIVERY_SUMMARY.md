## 🎯 What This Package Does

This package will help you:

1. ✅ **Add comprehensive testing** - Go from 0% to 40-80% coverage
2. ✅ **Modularize the backend** - Break down the 2,400 LOC monolith

---

## 🚀 How to Use This Package

### Quick Start (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Navigate to your TooLoo.ai repo in GitHub Codespaces

# 2. Copy all files from /home/claude/ to your repo root
cp -r /home/claude/.devcontainer .
