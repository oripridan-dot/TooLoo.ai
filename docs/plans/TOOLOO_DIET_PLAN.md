# TooLoo.ai Diet & Efficiency Plan

This document tracks the execution of the "Size and Efficiency Diet" to streamline the development workflow and gain total control over the system.

## Phase 1: Assessment & Analysis (Clarity & Insight)
- [x] **Initial Workspace Audit**: Identified cluttered root directory and loose documentation.
- [ ] **Documentation Consolidation**: Move loose Markdown files to `docs/`.
- [ ] **Root Cleanup**: Move loose script files to `scripts/` or `tests/`.
- [ ] **Codebase Audit**: Identify dead code and overlaps (Precog/Legacy).

## Phase 2: Solution Design & Implementation (Solid Foundation)
- [ ] **Standardization**: Enforce `eslint` and `prettier`.
- [ ] **Dependency Management**: Audit `package.json` for unused packages.
- [ ] **Testing Structure**: Organize tests into a coherent structure.

## Phase 3: Optimization & Refinement
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Verify `src/core/metrics-collector.ts` usage.
- [ ] **Cost Optimization**: Review provider usage.

## Phase 4: Continuous Improvement
- [ ] **Automated Workflows**: Enhance CI/CD scripts.
