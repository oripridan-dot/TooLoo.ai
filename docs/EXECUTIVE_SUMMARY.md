- Missing monitoring → Blind to issues
- No CI/CD → Manual, error-prone releases

### Proposed Solution
Systematic transformation over 3 months:
1. **Phase 1** (Week 1): Foundation - Testing, modularization, CI/CD
2. **Phase 2** (Weeks 2-4): Maturation - Complete refactoring
3. **Phase 3** (Weeks 5-12): Production readiness

### Expected Benefits
- **Quality**: 80% test coverage, automated validation
- **Speed**: 30% faster development cycles
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime target
- **Maintainability**: Clear architecture, easy onboarding
- **Confidence**: Metrics-driven decisions

### Investment vs. Alternatives

| Approach | Cost | Time | Risk | Outcome |
|----------|------|------|------|---------|
| **This Plan** | 5-7 days + 2d/mo | 3 months | Low | Production-ready |
| Rewrite from scratch | 3-6 months | 6-12 mo | High | Uncertain |
| Continue as-is | $0 upfront | Forever | Very High | Technical bankruptcy |
| Hire consultant | $20-50k | 2-3 mo | Medium | Dependency |

**Recommendation**: Execute this plan with internal team + Claude assistance
