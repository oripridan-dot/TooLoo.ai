### Pre-Flight Checklist
✅ Coach-Server integration complete (auto-coach + fast-lane active)  
✅ Orchestrator pre-arming validated (training → meta → coach flow)  
✅ Reports server monitoring ready (error rate, latency, uptime dashboards)  
✅ Budget server burst policy configured (provider rate limits set)  
✅ Load test plan signed off (1K → 50K learners phased)  

### Success Criteria (MUST PASS ALL)
- **Error Rate**: <0.5% across all training rounds

├─ Metrics green → Move to close monitoring Nov 4
└─ Error spike → Evaluate rollback vs. throttle

Nov 30 @ 23:59 UTC
├─ All deliverables → Dec 1 planning sprint
└─ Delayed → Extend to Dec 7, delay Phase 4 planning

Dec 27 @ 23:59 UTC (Planning complete)
├─ Runbooks ready → Jan 2 Sprint 1 start
└─ Blockers → Delay to Jan 9

Feb 28 @ 23:59 UTC (Sprint 2 complete)
