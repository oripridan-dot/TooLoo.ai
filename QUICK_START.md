## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Parser not detecting platform
**Fix**: Check sample JSON from each platform (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini have different structures)

### Issue: Scores all coming out the same
**Fix**: Verify scoring weights in `prompt-analyzer.js` - ensure dimensions vary

### Issue: UI not responsive
**Fix**: Check media queries in CSS - verify breakpoints at 768px and below

### Issue: Analysis takes >5 seconds
**Fix**: Optimize loop in `PromptAnalyzer.analyze()` - limit to first 50 prompts

3. **Collect Feedback**: Ask users "What surprised you most?" on day 2
