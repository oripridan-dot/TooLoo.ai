## 💡 TIPS FOR SUCCESS

1. **Read the summaries first**: Don't start with 115 KB of details. Start with the 11 KB summary.
2. **Know your role**: Each person should know their responsibilities for Nov 1-2.
3. **Prepare contingencies**: Read the incident procedures before they're needed.
4. **Clear your calendar**: Nov 1-3 will be intensive. Block time now.
5. **Trust the process**: These documents have been carefully planned with all leads' input.
6. **Ask questions early**: Don't wait until Nov 1 to clarify something unclear.
7. **Get sleep**: You'll need it. Nov 1-3 will be 48+ hours of active monitoring.
