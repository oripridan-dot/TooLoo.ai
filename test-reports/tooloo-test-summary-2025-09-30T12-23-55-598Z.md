## Recommendations
### 1. IMPROVEMENT: category-performance
**Priority**: high
**Issue**: Focus on improving performance in: metacognition, debugging, architecture, learning, optimization, refactoring, testing, collaboration, performance, planning
**Action**: Analyze failed prompts in these categories and adjust processing approach

## Next Steps
1. Review failed prompts and identify common failure patterns
2. Implement recommended optimizations
3. Re-run test to measure improvements
4. Consider expanding test suite with additional self-improvement prompts
