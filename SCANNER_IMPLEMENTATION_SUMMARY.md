## How to Use

### Quick Start (30 seconds)

```bash
# 1. Navigate to scanner directory
cd /workspaces/TooLoo.ai/web-app/scanner

# 2. Start local server
python3 -m http.server 8000

# 3. Open in browser
open http://localhost:8000/index.html
```

### First-Time User Workflow

1. **Paste** your prompt into the textarea
2. **Click** "üîç Analyze Prompt"
3. **Review** quality scores and keyword analysis
4. **Browse** refinement suggestions
5. **Select** which refinements to apply
6. **Compare** before/after versions
7. **Copy** or download your improved prompt

### Example Transformation

**Before**:
```
Write a blog post
```

**After**:
```
Create a comprehensive technical blog article for software engineers 
about microservices architecture. Include: introduction explaining 
core concepts (250 words), service boundaries deep-dive (300 words), 
communication patterns analysis (300 words), practical code examples, 
and conclusion with actionable takeaways (200 words). 
Avoid: marketing hype, oversimplification, and non-technical jargon.
```

**Results**:
- Quality Score: 2/10 ‚Üí 8.5/10
- Improvement: **+325%** üìà

## Key Innovation: Weighted Keywords

### The Problem
Traditional keyword extraction just lists words. Doesn't show importance.

### Our Solution
**Weighted Keywords** - Score each keyword by how important it is:

```
Formula: Weight = (Frequency √ó 0.35) + (Position √ó 0.30) + (Emphasis √ó 0.35)
```

**Example**: For "Create a blog post about AI"
```
AI        ‚Üí Weight 8.2 (appears early, emphasized)
create    ‚Üí Weight 5.1 (common action verb)
blog      ‚Üí Weight 4.8 (appears late, generic)
about     ‚Üí Weight 2.3 (common preposition)
```

**Result**: "AI" is the strongest keyword ‚Üí Keep and strengthen
"blog" is weak ‚Üí Replace with "technical article"

## Technical Highlights

### 1. Keyword Weighting Algorithm
- **Frequency Score**: How often keyword appears (normalized 0-1)
- **Position Score**: How early it appears (0-10 scale)
- **Emphasis Score**: Capitalization & punctuation (0-1 scale)
- **Combined Weight**: Balanced importance metric

### 2. Context Detection
Automatically identifies task type:
- **Action**: "Create", "Build", "Implement" ‚Üí Decisive language
- **Analysis**: "Analyze", "Examine", "Study" ‚Üí Precision language
- **Learning**: "Explain", "Teach", "Help understand" ‚Üí Teaching language
- **Problem-Solving**: "Fix", "Resolve", "Debug" ‚Üí Troubleshooting language
- **Strategy**: "Plan", "Develop", "Design" ‚Üí Strategic language

### 3. Impact Scoring
```
Impact = (Before Quality √ó 0.5) + (Refinery Potential √ó 0.5)
Estimated Improvement = (Impact Score √ó 100) / 10
```

### 4. Refinement Generation
- Context-aware word substitutions
- Reason-based explanations
- Impact estimates
- Ordered by highest impact first

## Quick Reference

### What Each Tab Shows

| Tab | Purpose | What You'll See |
|-----|---------|-----------------|
| üîë Keywords & Weights | See important terms | Tag cloud with weight percentages |
| ‚ú® Refinement Options | Get suggestions | Checkbox list of word replacements |
| üìà Impact Preview | Understand gains | Before/after score comparison |
| üîÑ Before & After | Verify changes | Side-by-side text comparison |

### What Each Score Means

| Score | Interpretation | Action |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| 0-3/10 | Very weak | Needs major refinement |
| 3-6/10 | Needs work | Apply selected refinements |
| 6-8/10 | Good | Minor improvements possible |
| 8-10/10 | Excellent | Already well-optimized |

### Impact Percentage Guide

| Impact | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| +50%+ | Major improvement | Replace "good" with "excellent" |
| +20-50% | Significant | Replace "write" with "develop" |
| +5-20% | Helpful | Capitalize emphasis words |
| +0-5% | Minor | Polish phrasing |

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Blank Page
**Solution**: 
1. Refresh browser (Ctrl+R)
2. Check browser console (F12) for errors
3. Ensure all `.js` files are present

### Issue: No Keywords Detected
**Solution**: 
- Try a longer, more descriptive prompt
- Short prompts naturally have fewer keywords

### Issue: Scripts Not Loading
**Solution**:
- Use local server: `python3 -m http.server 8000`
- Don't open file directly (file:// protocol blocks scripts)

### Issue: Export Not Working
**Solution**:
- Check browser allows downloads
- Try different browser if persists
