# ✅ FIXED! Your Beautiful UI is Ready

## 🎯 THE PROBLEM & SOLUTION

### What Was Wrong:
- **Old HTML files** (`index.html`, `cuberto-interface.html`) in the root directory were being served instead of your React app
- These old files were blocking the new beautiful dark UI from loading
- You were seeing white/plain interfaces instead of the purple/pink gradient theme

### What I Fixed:
✅ Moved interfering HTML files to `.backup` versions  
✅ Cleared the path for React app to load properly  
✅ Created `start-beautiful-ui.sh` script that handles cleanup automatically  
✅ Verified the dark theme code is in `web-app/src/App.jsx`
