---

## Step 2: Merge to Main

### Option A: Squash Merge (Recommended - Clean History)

```bash
# Switch to main and pull latest
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Merge feature branch with squash
git merge --squash feature/phase-2-sprint-2-cohort-gaps

BRANCH: feature/phase-2-sprint-2-cohort-gaps
CLOSE ISSUE: Closes #[issue-number] (if applicable)"

# Push to origin
git push origin main

# Delete feature branch (optional but clean)
git branch -d feature/phase-2-sprint-2-cohort-gaps
git push origin --delete feature/phase-2-sprint-2-cohort-gaps
```

### Option B: Merge Commit (Preserves History)

```bash
# Switch to main and pull latest
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Merge with merge commit
git merge feature/phase-2-sprint-2-cohort-gaps -m "Merge: Phase 2 Sprint 2 - Cohort-aware learning system

10+ commits implementing Tasks 2-6 with 95.2% test pass rate.
Production ready. See PHASE-2-SPRINT-2-COMPLETION-REPORT.md"

# Push to origin
git push origin main

# Delete feature branch (optional)
git branch -d feature/phase-2-sprint-2-cohort-gaps
git push origin --delete feature/phase-2-sprint-2-cohort-gaps
```

---

## Step 3: Verify Merge

```bash
# Confirm you're on main
git branch  # Should show * main

# Verify commits are in main
git log --oneline -3

# Should see the merge commit at top with all work incorporated

# Verify file is present
ls -la servers/capability-workflow-bridge.js
ls -la scripts/test-cohort-gaps.js

# Quick code check
wc -l servers/capability-workflow-bridge.js  # Should be ~900 lines
```

---

## Step 4: Production Deployment

### 4a. Pull Latest on Production Server

```bash
# SSH to production
ssh prod-user@production-server

# Navigate to app directory
cd /path/to/TooLoo.ai

# Fetch and pull latest main
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Verify files
ls -la servers/capability-workflow-bridge.js
ls -la scripts/test-cohort-gaps.js
```

### 4b. Restart Service

```bash
# Option 1: If using systemd
sudo systemctl restart tooloo-bridge-service

# Option 2: If using npm/node directly
npm run stop  # or kill any existing process
npm run start

# Option 3: If using pm2
pm2 restart "bridge-service"
pm2 save

# Option 4: If running via shell
# Kill existing process
pkill -f "node servers/capability-workflow-bridge.js"

# Start fresh
node servers/capability-workflow-bridge.js &
```

### 4c: Initialize Data Directory (First Time Only)

```bash
# Create JSONL data directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p data/bridge

# Verify directory
ls -la data/bridge/

# The JSONL file will be created automatically on first use
# No manual initialization needed
```

---

## Step 5: Verify Deployment

### 5a. Immediate Health Check (0-5 minutes)

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3010/health

# Expected: 200 OK or similar success response

# If not responding, check if service is running
ps aux | grep "node.*capability-workflow-bridge"

# Check logs for errors
tail -50 /var/log/tooloo/bridge.log  # or wherever logs go
```

### 5b. Endpoint Verification (5-10 minutes)

```bash
# Test Gap Analysis endpoint
curl "http://localhost:3010/api/v1/bridge/gaps-per-cohort/cohort-001"

# Expected: 200 or 404 (if cohort doesn't exist - that's OK)
# Should NOT see: 500, "Cannot find module", "undefined"

# Test Workflow endpoint
curl "http://localhost:3010/api/v1/bridge/workflows-per-cohort/cohort-001"

# Test ROI Track endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3010/api/v1/bridge/roi/track/cohort-001 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"workflowId":"wf-test","capabilitiesAdded":5,"cost":1000,"archetype":"Generalist"}'

# Expected: 200 or appropriate error

# Test ROI Trajectory
curl "http://localhost:3010/api/v1/bridge/roi/trajectory/cohort-001"

# Test ROI Compare
curl "http://localhost:3010/api/v1/bridge/roi/compare"
```

### 5c. Performance Check (10-15 minutes)

```bash
# Test latency with ab (Apache Bench)
ab -n 100 -c 10 "http://localhost:3010/api/v1/bridge/roi/compare"

# Expected:
# - Time taken for tests: <2 seconds
# - Mean response time: <200ms
# - Failed requests: 0

# If not installed, install it
sudo apt-get install apache2-utils

# Alternative: Use curl timing
for i in {1..10}; do
  time curl -s "http://localhost:3010/api/v1/bridge/roi/compare" > /dev/null
done

# Expected: All requests complete in <200ms
```

### 5d. JSONL File Check (15-20 minutes)

```bash
# Verify JSONL file was created (after first ROI track request)
ls -la data/bridge/cohort-roi.jsonl

# Should show file created with timestamp

# Check content (should be JSON lines)
head -5 data/bridge/cohort-roi.jsonl

# Each line should be valid JSON
cat data/bridge/cohort-roi.jsonl | jq . 2>/dev/null | head -20

# If jq not installed:
# sudo apt-get install jq
```

---

## Step 6: 24-Hour Monitoring

### Automated Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Watch logs in real-time
tail -f /var/log/tooloo/bridge.log | grep -i "error\|500\|404"

# Monitor for errors every 10 seconds
watch -n 10 'tail -20 /var/log/tooloo/bridge.log | grep -i "error"'

# Count errors in last hour
grep -i "error\|500" /var/log/tooloo/bridge.log | tail -3600 | wc -l

# Expected: 0 errors, or minimal expected 404s (missing cohorts)
```

### Periodic Health Checks (Every 4 hours)

```bash
# Script to run every 4 hours
cat > /tmp/health-check.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
echo "=== Health Check $(date) ==="
echo -n "Service: "
curl -s http://localhost:3010/health | grep -q "ok\|healthy" && echo "✅" || echo "❌"

echo -n "Gap Analysis: "
curl -s "http://localhost:3010/api/v1/bridge/gaps-per-cohort/test" | grep -q "200\|404\|error" && echo "✅" || echo "❌"

echo -n "Response Time: "
time curl -s "http://localhost:3010/api/v1/bridge/roi/compare" > /dev/null 2>&1

echo -n "JSONL File: "
test -f data/bridge/cohort-roi.jsonl && echo "✅ $(wc -l < data/bridge/cohort-roi.jsonl) records" || echo "⏳ Not created yet"

echo ""
EOF

chmod +x /tmp/health-check.sh

# Run manually or add to crontab
*/4 * * * * /tmp/health-check.sh >> /var/log/tooloo/health-check.log
```

---

## Step 7: Rollback Plan (If Needed)

### Emergency Rollback (Immediate)

```bash
# Option 1: Revert last commit on main
git revert -n HEAD
git commit -m "Revert: Phase 2 Sprint 2 - critical issue detected"
git push origin main

# Restart service
sudo systemctl restart tooloo-bridge-service

# Option 2: Go back to previous commit
git log --oneline -5
# Find the commit before the merge

git checkout <previous-commit-hash> -- servers/capability-workflow-bridge.js
git commit -m "Revert to previous version: <commit-message>"
git push origin main

# Restart service
sudo systemctl restart tooloo-bridge-service

# Option 3: Use git reset (destructive - only if absolutely necessary)
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git push -f origin main

# Restart service
sudo systemctl restart tooloo-bridge-service
```

### Check What Changed During Merge

```bash
# See diff between versions
git diff HEAD~1 HEAD -- servers/capability-workflow-bridge.js | head -100

# Count lines changed
git diff --stat HEAD~1 HEAD

# Check if main cause of issue is known
git log HEAD~1 --oneline -5
```

---

## Step 8: Update Documentation (Post-Deployment)

```bash
# Create deployment log entry
cat >> DEPLOYMENT-LOG.md << 'EOF'
## Phase 2 Sprint 2 Deployment

**Date**: $(date)
**Commit**: $(git rev-parse HEAD | cut -c1-7)
**Branch**: main
**Status**: ✅ Successfully deployed

### Pre-Deployment
- Code review: ✅
- Tests: 95.2% pass (60/63)
- Documentation: Complete (14 files)

### Deployment Steps
- [x] Merge to main
- [x] Pull on production
- [x] Restart service
- [x] Health checks passing
- [x] Endpoints responding

### Post-Deployment (24h monitoring)
- [x] No critical errors
- [x] Performance: <200ms maintained
- [x] Data persisting correctly
- [x] Ready for Phase 3

### Notes
- JSONL file: data/bridge/cohort-roi.jsonl
- Service port: 3010
- Logs: /var/log/tooloo/bridge.log
EOF

# Commit log entry
git add DEPLOYMENT-LOG.md
git commit -m "docs: Log Phase 2 Sprint 2 production deployment"
git push origin main
```

---

## Quick Troubleshooting

### Service Not Starting

```bash
# Check for syntax errors
node -c servers/capability-workflow-bridge.js

# Check if port is already in use
lsof -i :3010

# Kill any existing process on that port
pkill -f "node.*capability-workflow-bridge"

# Try starting with debug output
node --debug servers/capability-workflow-bridge.js
```

### High Latency

```bash
# Check service load
top -p $(pgrep -f "node.*capability-workflow-bridge")

# Check disk I/O (for JSONL writes)
iostat -x 1 5

# Check memory usage
free -h

# Restart if memory high
sudo systemctl restart tooloo-bridge-service
```

### Data Not Persisting

```bash
# Check directory permissions
ls -la data/bridge/

# Fix permissions if needed
chmod 755 data/bridge/

# Check disk space
df -h data/

# Verify write access
touch data/bridge/test.txt && rm data/bridge/test.txt && echo "✅ Writable"
```
