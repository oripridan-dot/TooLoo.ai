4. Fix and re-test (24 hours)
5. Reschedule ramp phase (Nov 3)

**Communication**: Stakeholder notification, incident report, remediation plan

### If Rollout Issues (Nov 2+)

**Scenario**: Production incident after full rollout

**Immediate Actions**:
1. Automatic rollback to previous version (<5 min)
2. Learner impact mitigation (automatic failover)
3. Incident response team activated
4. Root cause analysis
5. Fix, test, re-deploy (24-48 hours)

**Communication**: Status page, stakeholder updates, public statement if needed

### Contingency Windows

- **Oct 31 - Nov 1**: Canary observation period (fallback: re-test)
- **Nov 1**: Ramp execution + decision (fallback: hold and fix)
- **Nov 2**: Rollout deployment (fallback: staged rollback)
- **Nov 2-15**: Stabilization period (fallback: quick patches)
