# ✅ YOUR APP IS RUNNING!

## 🎯 The Problem You're Seeing

You're getting **HTTP 401 Unauthorized** because GitHub Codespaces has the port set to **Private** by default.

## 🔧 Quick Fix (30 seconds)

### Option 1: Make Port Public (Recommended)

1. **Look at the bottom of VS Code** - Find the **PORTS** tab
2. **Find port 5173** (your web app)
3. **Right-click on port 5173**
4. **Select "Port Visibility" → "Public"**
5. **Refresh your browser** (or click the globe icon again)

### Option 2: Use the Simple Browser in VS Code

1. Press **Cmd+Shift+P** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Shift+P** (Windows)
2. Type: **"Simple Browser"**
3. Select **"Simple Browser: Show"**
4. Enter URL: `http://localhost:5173`

## 📊 Current Status

✅ **API Server**: Running on port 3005 (PID: 73753)  
✅ **Web App**: Running on port 5173 (PID: 73827)  
✅ **Both services healthy and responding**

## 🌐 URLs

- **Web App**: http://localhost:5173 (works inside Codespace)
- **API**: http://localhost:3005 (works inside Codespace)

## 🐛 Why This Happened

GitHub Codespaces protects your ports by default with authentication. When you try to access the forwarded URL (`fluffy-doodle-q7gq7rx5wrxjh9v77-5173.app.github.dev`), it requires you to be logged in OR have the port set to Public.

## ✨ What's Working

Both your services are running perfectly:

```bash
# Test API
curl http://localhost:3005/api/v1/health
# Returns: {"status":"healthy",...}

# Test Web App  
curl http://localhost:5173
# Returns: HTML with title "TooLoo.ai - Your Personal AI Dev Assistant"
```

## 📝 Quick Commands

```bash
# Check status
ps aux | grep -E "(vite|simple-api-server)" | grep -v grep

# View logs
tail -f logs/api.log
tail -f logs/web.log

# Restart everything

**Just make port 5173 PUBLIC and refresh!** 🚀
