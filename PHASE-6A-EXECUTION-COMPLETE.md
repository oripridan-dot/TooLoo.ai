## Live Test Results

### Your Consensus Algorithm Solution
```
INPUT:
{
  "solution": "I would use Raft as the consensus algorithm because 
               it is simpler than Paxos and sufficient for 3 Byzantine 
               failures out of 9. The protocol would work as follows: 
               1) Leader election using heartbeat mechanism, 
               2) Replication on majority (5/9 nodes minimum), 
               3) Quorum-based writes ensure consistency. Network 
               partitions are handled by the minority partition becoming 
               read-only while the majority continues operating."
}
```

### System Feedback
```json
{
  "challengeId": "consensus-basic",
  "challengeTitle": "Consensus Algorithm Design",
  "submittedAt": "2025-10-20T22:11:49.410Z",
  "solutionLength": 495,
  "score": 82,
  "feedback": "Great attempt on 'Consensus Algorithm Design'! Your solution 
              demonstrates understanding of Consensus Algorithms, Byzantine 
              Fault Tolerance, Leader Election. To improve, consider: Hint 1: 
              Raft is simpler, Paxos more fault-tolerant",
  "nextSteps": [
    "Read real-world example: Kafka uses Raft for controller election. 
     Zookeeper uses modified Paxos.",
    "Try the Distributed Transactions challenge",
    "Review the hints provided"
  ],
  "passed": true,
  "message": "‚úÖ Challenge Passed!"
}
```

### Analysis
- **Score**: 82/100 ‚úÖ
- **Status**: PASSED (pass threshold: 75%)
- **Strengths Identified**: Correctly chose Raft, understood leader election, majority-based replication, network partition handling
- **Growth Opportunity**: Explore Paxos trade-offs more deeply
- **Real-World Context**: Linked to Kafka/Zookeeper implementations
