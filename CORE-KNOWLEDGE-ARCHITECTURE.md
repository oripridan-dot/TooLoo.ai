## üîÑ Dynamic Learning System Architecture

### Skill Acquisition Engine
```javascript
class DynamicLearningEngine {
  async acquireSkill(skillName, context, urgency = 'standard') {
    // 1. Assess current knowledge gaps
    const gaps = await this.analyzeKnowledgeGaps(skillName, context);
    
    // 2. Source authoritative materials
    const sources = await this.findAuthoritativeSources(skillName, {
      books: true,
      courses: true,
      documentation: true,
      expertPractices: true
    });
    
    // 3. Rapid synthesis and integration
    const knowledge = await this.synthesizeKnowledge(sources, gaps);
    
    // 4. Validate through practical application
    const validation = await this.validateThroughPractice(knowledge, context);
    
    return {
      skill: skillName,
      proficiency: validation.level,
      practicalApplications: validation.uses,
      confidenceLevel: validation.confidence
