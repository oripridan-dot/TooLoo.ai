## 🔴 Critical Issues Found

### Issue 1: Priority Endpoint Timing
**Endpoint:** `/api/v1/system/priority/chat`  
**Status:** 404 (timeout)  
**Location:** Orchestrator startup tries to call during web-server init  
**Root Cause:** Race condition - called before web-server fully ready  
**Fix:** Add retry logic with exponential backoff + error handling  
**Impact:** High - affects all startup flows  
**Priority:** P0 - Fix immediately

## 📋 QA Roadmap (Next 2 Weeks)

### Week 1: Critical Fixes + Core Coverage
```
Day 1: Fix P0 bugs (priority endpoint timeout)
       → Add retry logic to orchestrator startup
       → Verify all 14 web-server endpoints respond correctly

Day 2: Training server tests (19 endpoints)
       → POST /api/v1/training/start
       → GET /api/v1/training/status, /overview, /active
       → Hyper-speed endpoints
       → Plus all supporting endpoints

Day 3: Budget server tests (9 endpoints)
       → Provider status, burst generation
       → Budget tracking, cost analysis
       → Provider recommendations

Day 4: Meta-learning + Coach server (17 endpoints)
       → Meta-learning phases and reports
       → Auto-coach lifecycle
       → Boost and hyper-boost features

Day 5: Cup + Other services (14+ endpoints)
       → Tournament management
       → Product development workflows
       → Design generation
```

### Week 2: Advanced Testing
```
Day 1: E2E Workflow Tests (5 complete flows)
       → Feature request → intent creation
       → Intent → task decomposition
       → Task execution → artifact generation
       → Full provenance tracking
       → Error recovery flows

Day 2: Performance Testing
       → Response time baselines (< 200ms reads)
       → Throughput (100+ req/sec)
       → Memory stability (1h continuous)
       → Load testing (concurrent requests)

Day 3: Security Testing
       → Input validation (injection attempts)
       → Rate limiting enforcement
       → CORS validation
       → Auth token handling

Day 4: Regression Testing
       → Verify Phase 1 & 2 tests still passing
       → No breaks from new integrations
       → Performance degradation check

Day 5: Documentation + Cleanup
       → Update API documentation
       → Create QA guidelines
       → Generate final coverage report
       → Create regression test suite
```

### Expected Outcome
- ✅ 87/87 endpoints tested (100%)
- ✅ 200+ test cases (comprehensive)
- ✅ 500+ assertions (detailed validation)
- ✅ 95%+ pass rate (production ready)
- ✅ Zero critical issues
- ✅ Performance baselines established
- ✅ Security audit completed

## 📝 Next Immediate Action

**Priority P0 - Fix Critical Bug:**
```bash
# 1. Locate the issue in orchestrator.js (line 132)
# 2. Add retry logic with exponential backoff
# 3. Test orchestrator startup succeeds
# 4. Verify priority endpoint accessible
```

**Suggested Fix:**
```javascript
// In orchestrator.js startup code:
if (applyPriority) {
  let retries = 0;
  while (retries < 5) {
    try {
      await fetch(`http://127.0.0.1:${process.env.WEB_PORT||3000}/api/v1/system/priority/chat`, 
        { method:'POST', timeout: 2000 });
      console.log('Startup priority applied: chat-priority');
      break;
    } catch (e) {
      retries++;
      if (retries < 5) await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 500 * Math.pow(2, retries)));
      else console.warn('Priority mode unavailable during startup (non-fatal)');
    }
  }
}
```
