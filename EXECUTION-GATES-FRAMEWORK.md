## üéØ Gate System Overview

Every major phase includes **decision gates** at key milestones. Each gate has:
- **Success Criteria** (quantified, unambiguous)
- **Go/No-Go Logic** (pass ‚Üí proceed; fail ‚Üí hold/rollback)
- **Escalation Path** (who decides, timeline for decision)
- **Rollback Procedure** (if needed)

---

## PHASE 3: COACH-SERVER INTEGRATION (‚úÖ COMPLETE AS OF OCT 20)

**Decision**: Proceed to Phase 4 (Nov 1 Gate 1)

---

## PHASE 4: RAMP & SCALE-OUT (Nov 1 ‚Äì Feb 28, 2025)

### GATE 1: Nov 1 @ 13:00‚Äì18:00 UTC (Pre-Ramp Go/No-Go)

**Purpose**: Final smoke test before ramping from 5K ‚Üí 50K learners  
**Decision Authority**: VP Engineering (final call)  
**Decision Window**: 5 hours (13:00 ‚Üí 18:00 UTC)

#### Pre-Flight Checklist (Must Pass ALL)
```

#### Success Criteria (2-Hour Load Test: 5K ‚Üí 10K learners)

| Metric | Target | Pass Threshold | Current (Canary) |
|--------|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| Error Rate | <0.5% | ‚úÖ if <0.6% | 0.079% |
| Latency (p95) | <200ms | ‚úÖ if <250ms | 45ms |
| Latency (p99) | <500ms | ‚úÖ if <600ms | 120ms |
| Uptime | >99.95% | ‚úÖ if >99.90% | 99.97% |
| Coach Throughput | >100 rounds/min | ‚úÖ if >90 rounds/min | 180 rounds/min |
| Training Round Time | <5 sec | ‚úÖ if <7 sec | 2.1 sec |
| Meta Trigger Delay | <100ms | ‚úÖ if <150ms | 45ms |
| Zero Crashes | Yes | ‚úÖ if 0 critical restarts | ‚Äî |

#### Decision Logic

```
IF all_metrics_pass THEN
  DECISION = "GO ‚Üí Proceed to Gate 2 (Nov 2 @ 16:00 UTC)"
  ACTION = Email go-ahead to command team
  
ELSE IF error_rate OR latency FAILED THEN
  IF fix_requires < 2 hours THEN
    ACTION = Apply hotfix, re-test subset (15 min)
  ELSE
    DECISION = "HOLD 1 week ‚Üí Reassess Nov 8"
    REASON = "Not confident in scaling 5x within 24h"
  END
  
ELSE IF coach_throughput FAILED THEN
  DECISION = "HOLD 48 hours"
  ACTION = Investigate fast-lane timers, restart with higher intervals
  RETEST = Nov 3 @ 13:00 UTC
  
ELSE IF uptime FAILED THEN
  DECISION = "NO-GO ‚Üí Extended canary, hold ramp"
  ACTION = Escalate to infrastructure lead, debug P0 alert
  REASSESS = Nov 8 @ 18:00 UTC
END
```

#### Escalation Paths

| Failure | Owner | Action | Duration | Retest |
|---------|-------|--------|----------|--------|
| **Error >0.5%** | Training Lead | 1. Audit domain selection 2. Check training round logic 3. Reduce aggressive mode | 2 hours | Yes, 15-min window |
| **Latency >250ms** | Infrastructure Lead | 1. Check provider latency 2. Monitor CPU/memory 3. Profile training round | 1.5 hours | Yes, 15-min |
| **Coach Stall** | Coach Owner | 1. Restart fast-lane 2. Check meta-learning queue 3. Inspect logs for deadlocks | 1 hour | Yes, 10-min |
| **Uptime <99.90%** | Infrastructure Lead | Escalate to VP Eng ‚Üí investigate P0 alert | 4 hours | Postpone gate, retry Nov 8 |

#### Rollback Procedure (If Needed)
**Level 0** (if gate fails, before scaling):
1. Stop new learner registrations
2. Hold current scale at 5K canary
3. Return to Oct 20 controller settings
4. Investigation period: 48 hours ‚Üí 1 week

**Timeline**: <5 minutes (simple revert)

---

### GATE 2: Nov 2 @ 16:00 UTC (FULL ROLLOUT BEGINS)

**Purpose**: Launch full ramp with intensive monitoring  
**Duration**: 40 hours (Nov 2 @ 16:00 ‚Üí Nov 4 @ 08:00 UTC)  
**Control**: Auto-advance learner ramp every 1 hour if metrics green

#### Ramp Schedule
| Time | Phase | Learners | Status | Alert Threshold |
|------|-------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Nov 2 @ 16:00 | Start | 5K | Baseline | Error <1% |
| Nov 2 @ 17:00 | Ramp 1 | 10K | +100% | Error <0.8% |
| Nov 2 @ 18:00 | Ramp 2 | 25K | +150% | Error <0.5% |
| Nov 2 @ 19:00 | Ramp 3 | 50K | +100% | Error <0.2% |
| Nov 2 @ 20:00 | Sustain | 50K | Hold 20h | Error <0.1% |

#### Success Criteria (MUST HOLD FOR 20 HOURS)

| Metric | Target | Nov 2‚Äì3 |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Error Rate | <0.1% | All stages |
| Latency (p95) | <50ms | <100ms acceptable |
| Uptime | >99.99% | No outages >5 min |
| Revenue Signal | +5.8% | Confirmed by reports-server |

    "meta_trigger_delay_ms": 42,
    "fast_lane_enabled": true
  },
  "alert_level": "normal",
  "recommendation": "continue_ramp"
}
```

**Alert Triggers**:
- Error >0.15% ‚Üí Yellow alert, notify training lead
- Error >0.25% ‚Üí Red alert, consider throttle
- Latency (p95) >150ms ‚Üí Yellow, notify infra lead
- Uptime <99.98% ‚Üí Red, possible rollback
- Revenue signal not increasing ‚Üí Yellow, check reports-server

#### Decision at Nov 4 @ 08:00 UTC (Rollout Review)

**IF metrics green for full 40h ‚Üí PASS**:

- ‚úÖ Proceed to Nov 15 gate (production baseline)

**IF yellow alerts but contained ‚Üí CONDITIONAL PASS**:
- ‚úÖ Continue with targeted fixes
- ‚úÖ Escalate to optimization track
- ‚úÖ Maintain intensive monitoring 48h more

**IF red alert or repeated failures ‚Üí FAIL**:
- ‚ùå Evaluate throttle (50K ‚Üí 25K learners, hold)
- ‚ùå OR rollback to Nov 1 state
- ‚ùå Reassess rollout in 72 hours

#### Rollback Procedure (Level 1‚Äì2)

**Level 1: Throttle Ramp** (5 min):
```bash
# Hold learner scale at last stable point
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/system/scale \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"learners": 25000, "hold": true}'

# Notification
echo "üö® Rollout throttled to 25K learners (was 50K)" > /incident-channel
```

**Level 2: Revert to Nov 1 Canary** (15 min):
```bash
# Restore user state from Nov 1 snapshot
aws s3 cp s3://tooloo-backups/nov-1-canary-state.tgz /tmp/ && \
tar xzf /tmp/nov-1-canary-state.tgz -C /data && \
npm run restart:all

echo "üö® Rollback complete ‚Üí Nov 1 canary state restored" > /incident-channel
```

## üö® Cross-Gate Escalation Matrix

### Critical Failure Scenario

**Scenario**: Coach-Server crashes, meta-learning stops, training grinds to halt during Nov 2 rollout

**Escalation Steps**:
1. **t=0 min**: Incident detection (alert fires)
2. **t=1 min**: Coach-server owner restart (attempt 1)
3. **t=2 min**: Notify training lead + infrastructure lead (Slack + PagerDuty)
4. **t=3 min**: If restart fails, escalate to VP Engineering
5. **t=5 min**: If VP Eng can't reach, escalate to CEO (emergency call)
6. **t=10 min**: Decision: rollback vs. fix ‚Üí execute

**Rollback Criteria** (automatic if not fixed in 10 min):
- Learner scale drops to 25K (hold)
- Revert to Oct 20 controller settings
- Investigation period begins

**Impact on Gates**: 
- If during Gate 2: rollout delayed to Nov 8
- If during Gate 3+: no impact (rollout already passed)
