## Pattern Recognition

### Weak Prompt Indicators
🚩 Excessive use of: something, thing, stuff, whatever, etc.
🚩 Vague verbs: do, make, help, get, put
🚩 Missing specificity: "good", "better", "efficient"
🚩 No audience definition
🚩 No success criteria

### Strong Prompt Indicators
✅ Specific context and constraints
✅ Defined audience or use case
✅ Clear success metrics
✅ Examples or reference points
✅ Specific format requirements

### Most Common Refinements Needed
1. **Replace vague verbs** (do → implement; help → provide; make → create)
2. **Add specificity** (good → measurable; better → +X% improvement)
3. **Define metrics** (efficiency → <100ms latency; accuracy → >95%)
4. **Clarify audience** (person → software architect with 5+ years experience)
5. **Add constraints** (no → avoid this approach because)
