## 🎯 Key Features

### Multi-Factor Keyword Weighting
```
Weight = (Frequency 35%) + (Position 30%) + (Emphasis 35%) × Weakness Factor
```

- **Detects which keywords matter most** in the prompt
- **Accounts for word placement** (keywords at start/end rank higher)
- **Identifies emphasis patterns** (looks for emphasis indicators)
- **Prioritizes weak words** (1.3× multiplier for refinement priority)

### Context-Aware Suggestions
- ⚡ **Action**: Strengthen action verbs (write → compose, create → develop)
- 🔍 **Analysis**: Improve analytical precision (look → examine, thing → element)
- 🎓 **Learning**: Enhance clarity (really → genuinely, very → extremely)
- 🔧 **Problem-Solving**: Focus on solutions (fix → resolve, bad → ineffective)
- 📋 **Strategy**: Structure thinking (plan → blueprint, way → method)

### Measurable Impact Scoring
Each suggestion includes:
- **Impact Score** (0-10): How much this change improves clarity
- **Estimated Improvement**: Keyword weight × impact × context factor
- **Measurable Outcome**: Specific results (e.g., "+25% clarity")
- **Difficulty Level**: low/medium/high effort to implement

### Interactive UI with 6 Sections

1. **Summary Card** - Overview with context badge
2. **Metrics Dashboard** - Avg impact, keyword counts, weak word count
3. **Quick Wins** - Easy, high-impact changes first
4. **Top Recommendations** - Full ranked suggestions (up to 10)
5. **Before/After** - Side-by-side comparison with copy button
6. **Implementation Guide** - 3-phase approach from quick wins to high-impact

## 📈 Impact Examples

### Example 1: Weak Descriptors
```
Before: "Write a good function that works really well"
After:  "Write an excellent function that operates effectively"
Changes: 
  - good → excellent (+8 impact, 25% quality bump)
  - really → exceptionally (+7 impact, 20% strength boost)
  - works well → operates effectively (+9 impact, 30% precision)
Estimated Total Improvement: +6.8 points
```

### Example 2: Generic Nouns
```
Before: "Handle the different types of things in the data"
After:  "Process the diverse formats in the dataset"
Changes:
  - types → formats (+7 impact, specificity)
  - things → elements (+8 impact, professionalism)
Estimated Total Improvement: +5.3 points
```

### Example 3: Problem-Solving Context
```
Before: "I have a bad issue where the thing doesn't work"
After:  "I have a critical issue where the component fails"
Changes:
  - bad → critical (+9 impact, urgency)
  - thing → component (+8 impact, technical)
  - doesn't work → fails (+7 impact, clarity)
Estimated Total Improvement: +7.1 points
```

## 🚀 Usage (3 Lines to Start)

```javascript
const engine = new RefineryEngine();
const analysis = engine.analyze(userPrompt);
ui.render(analysis);  // Displays all results
```

## 📊 Output Structure

```javascript
analysis = {
  originalPrompt: "...",
  contextType: "action",                    // Detected intent
  keywords: [...],                           // All extracted keywords
  weightedKeywords: [...],                   // Keywords with weights
  refinements: [...],                        // All suggestions
  impactScore: 6.2,                         // Overall impact
  recommendations: [...],                    // Top 10 ranked
  report: {
    summary: { ... },                        // High-level overview
    topKeywordsToRefine: [ ... ],           // Most important keywords
    topRecommendations: [ ... ],            // Ranked suggestions
    quickWins: [ ... ],                     // Easy, high-impact only
    implementationGuide: { ... },           // Phase-by-phase approach
    metrics: { ... }                        // Stats & scores
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Integration Points

### With Chat Parser
```javascript
// Parse chat export → extract prompts → analyze with refinery
const messages = chatParser.parse(chatJSON);
const prompts = messages.filter(m => m.role === 'user');
prompts.forEach(p => {
  const analysis = engine.analyze(p.content);
  // Store refinement suggestions
});
```

### With Scanner UI
```html
<!-- Add to scanner-ui.html -->
<div id="refinery-results"></div>

<script>
  ui.render(analysis);  // Renders all 6 sections
</script>
```

### Export Options
```javascript
// JSON export
const json = ui.exportAsJSON();

// CSV export
const csv = ui.exportAsCSV();

// Text report
const text = engine.generateReport(analysis);
```

## ✨ Advanced Features

### Extract Quick Wins
```javascript
const wins = analysis.report.topRecommendations
  .filter(r => r.difficulty === 'low' && r.priority === 'high')
  .slice(0, 3);
```

### Generate Refined Prompt
```javascript
const refined = engine.generateRefinedPrompt(analysis, 5);
// refined.refined = new prompt with top 5 changes applied
// refined.changes = array of changes made
// refined.totalEstimatedImprovement = total score gain
```

### Batch Processing
```javascript
const engine = new RefineryEngine();
const prompts = [...];
const results = prompts.map(p => engine.analyze(p));
// Process 100+ prompts in seconds
```

3. **Measurable outcomes**
   - Every suggestion includes quantified improvement estimate
   - Users know exactly how much each change helps

4. **Ranked by effort/impact balance**
   - Quick wins surface first (3 minutes, +2 points)
   - Complex changes shown as "high-impact" alternatives
   - Users can choose their own effort level

5. **Complete before/after**
   - Visual side-by-side comparison
   - Shows exactly what changed
