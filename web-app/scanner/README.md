## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Algorithm Excellence
```
Keyword Weight = (Frequency × 0.35) + (Position × 0.30) + (Emphasis × 0.35)
- Frequency: How often keyword appears (normalized 0-1)
- Position: How early it appears in prompt (0-10 scale)
- Emphasis: Capitalization, punctuation markers (0-1 scale)
```

### Context Intelligence
- Auto-detects task type from keywords and patterns
- Generates context-specific suggestions
- Action context vs. Analysis context produce different refinements
- Learning context recognizes educational goals

### Impact Scoring
- Combined quality + refinery analysis
- Before/after comparison
- Percentage improvement calculation
- Visual feedback with bar charts

## 📞 Support

### If Something Doesn't Work

1. **Blank page**: Refresh browser (Ctrl+R), check browser console (F12)
2. **Scripts not loading**: Make sure all `.js` files are in same directory
3. **No keywords found**: Try a longer, more descriptive prompt
4. **Wrong suggestions**: Different prompts produce different analyses (expected)

### Documentation
