## What You'll See

### Tab 1: Keywords & Weights üîë
Shows your prompt's important terms, ranked by "weight" (importance score)

```
Example output for "Create a blog post about AI":
- create (75% weight)
- blog (65% weight)  
- post (60% weight)
- about (40% weight)
- AI (85% weight) ‚Üê Most important
```

**What this means**: "AI" is your strongest keyword. "blog" and "post" are weaker and could be replaced.

### Tab 2: Refinement Options ‚ú®
Shows specific word replacements with estimated impact

```
Example output:
[Checkbox] create ‚Üí develop/design (+25% impact)
           Reason: More active, specific for content creation
           
[Checkbox] blog ‚Üí technical article (+30% impact)
           Reason: More specific audience and format
```

**What to do**: Check the boxes for changes you want, then click "Apply Selected Refinements"

### Tab 3: Impact Preview üìà
Shows before/after quality scores

```
Before: 45%  ‚ñê‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñå
After:  72%  ‚ñê‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñå
Improvement: +60%
```

### Tab 4: Before & After üîÑ
Side-by-side comparison of your original vs. refined prompt

```
ORIGINAL: Create a blog post about AI
IMPROVED: Develop a comprehensive technical article about artificial intelligence 
          for software engineers covering practical implementation strategies
```

## Real Example: Your First Refinement

### Start Here:
```
Write code that makes the app faster
```

### Scanner Results:

**Quality Score**: 2/10 ‚ùå
- Clarity: 0/2 (Vague - what app? what code?)
- Format: 0/2 (No format specified)
- Completeness: 1/2 (Missing context)

**Keywords Detected**:
```
write (40%) ‚Üê weak verb
code (65%) ‚Üê generic
faster (35%) ‚Üê vague metric
app (50%) ‚Üê undefined
```

**Refinements Suggested**:
```
‚úÖ write ‚Üí implement/optimize
‚úÖ code ‚Üí performance optimization layer
‚úÖ faster ‚Üí sub-500ms latency improvements
‚úÖ app ‚Üí web application
```

### After Refinement:
```
Implement a performance optimization layer for the web application 
to achieve sub-500ms latency improvements. Focus on:
- Database query optimization
- Caching strategy implementation
- Code profiling and bottleneck removal
```

**New Score**: 7.5/10 ‚úÖ
**Improvement**: +275%

## Key Concepts

### What is "Weight"?
A score (0-10) showing how important a keyword is. Calculated by:
- **35%** How often it appears (frequency)
- **30%** How early it appears (position)
- **35%** Emphasis (capitalization, punctuation)

**Higher weight = More important ‚Üí Keep or strengthen**
**Lower weight = Weak term ‚Üí Replace with refinement**

### What is "Impact"?
The estimated quality improvement if you apply that refinement.

```
+50% impact = This refinement adds significant strength to your prompt
+20% impact = Helpful but not critical
+5% impact = Minor improvement
```

### What is "Context"?
The type of task your prompt is describing:
- **Action** - Do something (implement, build, create)
- **Analysis** - Understand something (analyze, examine, study)
- **Learning** - Learn something (explain, teach, understand)
- **Problem-Solving** - Fix something (resolve, troubleshoot, debug)
- **Strategy** - Plan something (develop, strategize, plan)

## Common Prompt Types to Try

### 1. Programming Request
```
Write code to calculate factorial
```
üëÜ Try this! Watch it suggest specific language, algorithm type, error handling

### 2. Writing Request
```
Write an article about climate change
```
üëÜ Try this! See how it refines audience, length, tone, and structure

### 3. Analysis Request
```
Analyze the data
```
üëÜ Try this! Watch the refinements add specificity about metrics, format, audience

### 4. Learning Request
```
Teach me about JavaScript
```
üëÜ Try this! See how it adjusts for experience level and learning objectives

### 5. Complex Request (Best Results)
```
Create a comprehensive guide for junior developers on implementing CI/CD pipelines. 
Include: 1) core concepts, 2) tool comparison (GitHub Actions vs Jenkins vs GitLab CI), 
3) step-by-step setup for a Node.js app, 4) best practices. Use code examples. 
Avoid: excessive jargon, DevOps-specific terminology, enterprise complexity. 
Target audience: 2-3 years of development experience, no DevOps background.
```
üëÜ Try this! Already strong - see minimal refinements needed

## Why This Matters

### Before Refinement
```
Write a tutorial
```
‚Üí ChatGPT response: Generic, might miss key details, wrong length/depth

### After Refinement
```
Create a step-by-step Node.js tutorial for junior developers (2-3 years experience) 
on implementing GraphQL APIs. Include: architecture overview (500 words), setup instructions 
with npm packages (300 words), 5 code examples (100 words each), and troubleshooting section (200 words). 
Assume familiarity with Express.js but not GraphQL. Avoid: excessive type system complexity, 
unrelated performance optimization, advanced federation patterns.
```
‚Üí ChatGPT response: Precise, targeted, correct length/depth, includes everything you need

**Result**: You get what you actually wanted instead of a generic response.

## Quick Tips

### ‚úÖ DO
- Use specific metrics ("sub-100ms" vs "fast")
- Define your audience clearly
- Specify format and length
- Include constraints (what NOT to do)
- Add examples of what you want

### ‚ùå DON'T
- Use vague verbs (do, make, help, get)
- Assume the AI knows context (specify it!)
- Skip constraints (AI needs boundaries)
- Ask for the "best" (best for whom? measured how?)
- Use "you" without defining reader

## Keyboard Shortcuts

(If implemented in future versions)

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+Enter` | Analyze prompt |
| `Ctrl+Shift+C` | Copy improved prompt |
| `Ctrl+Shift+D` | Download report |

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No keywords detected"
‚úÖ **Normal for very short prompts**
Try: Add more detail to your prompt

### "Impact preview shows 0%"
‚úÖ **Means your prompt is already excellent**
Result: You don't need many changes!

### "Browser says file not found"
‚úÖ **Make sure you're serving the files**
Try: `python3 -m http.server 8000` in the scanner directory

### "Scripts not loading (blank page)"
‚úÖ **JavaScript files need to load first**
Try: 
1. Refresh the page (Ctrl+R)
2. Check browser console for errors (F12)
3. Make sure all `.js` files exist in the directory

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Analyze 3-5 of your old prompts** - See how the scanner evaluates them
2. ‚úÖ **Refine one prompt** - Apply suggested improvements and use it in ChatGPT
3. ‚úÖ **Track results** - Compare AI responses before/after refinement
4. ‚úÖ **Share findings** - Tell us how much better your results got!
