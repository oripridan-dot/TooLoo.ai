## 📊 OUTCOME

### What Was Built

**AI Chat Scanner v1.0** - A complete, production-ready prompt analysis and refinement system that:

1. **Analyzes** ChatGPT/Claude prompts across 5 quality dimensions
2. **Detects** weighted keywords using frequency + position + emphasis scoring
3. **Suggests** context-aware refinements for maximum impact
4. **Visualizes** measurable improvements before and after
5. **Enables** users to export, share, and apply improvements

### Core Innovation: Weighted Keyword Detection

```
Weight = (Frequency × 0.35) + (Position × 0.30) + (Emphasis × 0.35)
```

**Result**: Each keyword gets a 0-10 importance score, showing users what matters most
