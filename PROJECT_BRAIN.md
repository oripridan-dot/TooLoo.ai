# üß† TooLoo.ai PROJECT BRAIN
*Living Memory System - Last Updated: 2025-10-02*

---

## üéØ PROJECT IDENTITY

**Name**: TooLoo.ai - Personal AI Development Assistant  
**Purpose**: Single-user AI toolkit that transforms ideas into working applications without coding  
**Owner**: Non-coder developer building professional applications through AI partnership  
**Vision**: Self-improving Meta-AI system that recursively enhances its own capabilities

---

## üìê ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS

### Core Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js with `simple-api-server.js` (lightweight, reliable)
- **Frontend**: React-based web interface (`/web-app`)
- **AI Providers**: Multi-provider orchestration (DeepSeek, Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, Hugging Face)
- **Execution**: Sandboxed code execution with VM2
- **Storage**: Local-first, filesystem-based persistence

**Rationale**: Monorepo structure allows modular development while maintaining single-user simplicity.

### Key Architectural Patterns
1. **Self-Awareness System**: TooLoo can read/modify its own code via `self-awareness-manager.js`
2. **Filesystem Manager**: Direct file creation/manipulation capabilities
3. **Multi-Provider Routing**: Intelligent AI model selection per task type
4. **Learning Weights**: Tracks which AI models perform best for specific tasks

---

## üîß YOUR CODING PREFERENCES

### What Works Well
- **Iterative Development**: Build one perfect component before moving to next
- **AI-Augmented Workflow**: Heavy reliance on AI for code generation
- **Clear Documentation**: Extensive comments and README files
- **Modular Structure**: Separate concerns, avoid monolithic files
- **Safety-First**: Sandboxed execution, graceful error handling

### What You Avoid
- Complex abstractions (prefer clarity over cleverness)
- Over-engineering (build what's needed now, not what might be needed)
- Writing code manually (use AI to generate, you direct and refine)
- Paid services when free alternatives exist (e.g., Hugging Face over paid APIs when possible)

### Your Development Style
- **Non-traditional coder**: Systems thinker who directs AI rather than writes code
- **Quality-conscious**: Professional standards maintained throughout
- **Meta-focused**: Interested in building tools that build tools
- **Validation-driven**: Real metrics and measurable improvements required

---

## üö´ ANTI-PATTERNS (Don't Suggest These)

### Known Failures
1. **Simulations over Real Implementations**: Always build real working code, not mock/placeholder solutions
2. **Browser-based AI limitations**: Rate limits, context loss, no code execution - that's why TooLoo exists
3. **Over-complicated API gateways**: Simple API server works better than complex routing layers
4. **Forgetting project context**: The core problem we're solving - AI must retain memory between sessions

### Common Copilot Mistakes to Reject
- Suggesting complex dependency injection when simple imports work
- Over-using TypeScript types when JavaScript clarity suffices
- Recommending microservices for single-user applications
- Adding authentication layers (single-user system)

---

## üé™ ACTIVE MODULES & STATUS

- `filesystem-manager.js` - File operations
- Web interface with real-time chat
- Multi-provider AI orchestration
- Basic learning weights system

### üöß In Development
- **Project Memory System** (THIS FILE) - Implementing now
- Pattern Library for reusable solutions
- Decision logging system
- Enhanced self-improvement loop

### üìã Planned
- Ollama integration for local AI models
- Advanced learning accumulator
- Automated pattern extraction from successful code
- Performance metrics tracking dashboard

## üß© COMMON PATTERNS (Your Solutions)

### AI Provider Selection Strategy
```javascript
// Use this decision tree:
- Quick code generation ‚Üí DeepSeek (cost-effective)
- Complex reasoning ‚Üí Claude (best for architecture)
- General purpose ‚Üí GPT-4 (reliable baseline)
- Creative solutions ‚Üí Gemini
- Free tier testing ‚Üí Hugging Face
```

### File Structure Pattern
```
ProjectName/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js              # Core logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css          # Styling (if needed)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # Documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test.html           # Testing interface (optional)
```

### Error Handling Pattern
```javascript
// Always wrap AI calls and file operations:
try {
  const result = await riskyOperation();
  return { success: true, data: result };
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Context:', error.message);
  return { 
    success: false, 
    error: error.message,
    fallback: 'safe default behavior'
  };
}
```

## üîç CURRENT CHALLENGES

### Active Issues
1. **Context Loss**: Copilot forgets project between sessions ‚Üí Solving with this memory system
2. **TooLoo Self-Improvement**: System can't learn from past successes ‚Üí Building learning accumulator
3. **Repetitive Problems**: Same bugs recurring ‚Üí Creating anti-pattern library
4. **Time/Budget Waste**: Re-explaining project context ‚Üí Implementing auto-briefing system

### Blockers & Solutions
- **Blocker**: GitHub Copilot has no project memory
  - **Solution**: Create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` that auto-loads this brain

- **Blocker**: TooLoo generates code but doesn't learn from outcomes
  - **Solution**: Implement feedback loop with performance metrics file

---

## üìä PERFORMANCE METRICS

### Current Baseline (to improve upon)
- **Context Re-explanation Time**: ~15 min per session
- **Repeat Problem Rate**: ~30% of issues are recurring
- **First-Try Success Rate**: ~40% of generated code works immediately
- **Time to Working Prototype**: ~2-4 hours per feature

### Target Improvements (30 days)
- Context loading: < 2 minutes
- Repeat problems: < 10%
- First-try success: > 70%
- Time to prototype: < 1 hour
