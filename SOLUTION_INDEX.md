## 💡 The Big Idea

### Problem
App analyzes thinking patterns (abstract) → No clear value

### Insight
Users don't want to understand thinking → They want better ChatGPT results

### Solution
Build "AI Chat Scanner" → Show users what's missing from their prompts

### Impact
Users apply improvements → 30-50% better results → Habit loop → Viral growth

### Scale
100M+ ChatGPT users × 1% = 1M users × $60/year avg = $60M+ TAM
