## Quick Health Checks
```bash
# Overall system
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/system/status

# All services
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/loadbalance/health

# Specific service
curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/health          # training
curl http://127.0.0.1:3003/health          # budget
curl http://127.0.0.1:3006/health          # product
```

## Critical Routes
```
POST /api/v1/chat/message         → Chat with synthesis
POST /api/v1/training/start       → Start training
POST /api/v1/auto-coach/boost     → Boost session
POST /api/v1/design/import-figma  → Import Figma tokens (NEW)
POST /api/v1/design/generate-css  → Generate CSS
POST /api/v1/orchestrator/activate/one → Activate workflow
```

## Service Dependencies
```
web-server → training (3001)
          → budget (3003)
          → coach (3004)
          → product (3006)
          → segmentation (3007)
          → reports (3008)
          → capabilities (3009)
          → providers (3010+)
          → orchestrator (3123)
```

## Common Issues & Solutions
```
❌ Service unavailable (503)
   → Check if service is running on correct port
   → Run: npm run dev

❌ Proxy error on /api/v1/design/*
   → Product server not running
   → Check port 3006

❌ Budget check failing
   → Budget server down
   → Check port 3003

❌ Figma token import fails
   → Verify Figma token is valid
   → Check internet connection
```

## Test Connectivity
```bash
bash test-system-connectivity.sh
# Expected: 20/20 passing
```

## Pro Tips
```
1. Use /api/v1/system/routes to see all proxy mappings
2. Check /api/v1/loadbalance/health for service status
3. Most endpoints support both GET and POST (except specified)
4. All POST endpoints require Content-Type: application/json
5. Figma integration requires valid FIGMA_TOKEN in env
6. GitHub integration requires valid GITHUB_TOKEN in env
