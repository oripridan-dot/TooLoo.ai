**Strategic Positioning**: Structured intelligence spine for Human Intent & Best Practices service — transforms chaotic strategic dialogue into benchmarked coaching leverage.

## The Problem
Strategic thinking quality remains invisible until costly build cycles reveal gaps. Product conversations overflow into fragmented docs and chat silos. Teams lack shared cognitive metrics for vision-execution balance. Current coaching relies on senior intuition — inconsistent and non-compounding.

## Core Mechanism
**INGEST** (real + synthetic strategic conversations) → **EXTRACT** (thinking patterns, trait profiles, reliability scores) → **COMPARE** (benchmark against 200+ product signatures, surface percentile gaps) → **COACH** (narrative strengths, growth drills, focus risk alerts) → **EVOLVE** (pattern library absorbs novel approaches, raises baseline quality).

## Distinct Edge
- **Conversation-first fidelity**: Captures strategic nuance forms miss
- **Living benchmark**: 200+ evolving signatures with objective percentiles  
- **Action-native outputs**: Prescriptions and priority lists, not just dashboards
- **Balance detection**: Prevents over-concentration early via focus risk scoring
- **Self-evolving library**: Structural compounding moat through pattern absorption

## Validation Signals
Stable reliability trajectories across evolution cycles. Clear archetype separation (innovation vs execution-heavy). Prescriptions demonstrably rebalance over-concentrated profiles. Incremental rebuild enables seconds-scale iteration.

## Integration Value
**Story Library Alignment**: Map live patterns to success/failure analogs. **Coaching Cadence**: Weekly intelligence packets drive focused moves. **Portfolio Oversight**: Surface where intent clarity decays. **Talent Development**: Trait gap drills tied to conversational exemplars.

## Forward Path
**Phase 1** (0-3mo): Real transcript ingestion, semantic novelty, refined reliability. **Phase 2** (3-6mo): Live meeting feedback, API endpoints, pattern clustering. **Phase 3** (6-12mo): Cross-org benchmark networks, predictive decision quality.

**Strategic Outcome**: Continuously upgrading cognitive infrastructure that standardizes strategic dialogue quality across the Human Intent ecosystem.
