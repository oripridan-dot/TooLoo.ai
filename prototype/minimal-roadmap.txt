Minimal Roadmap (Execution Phases)

Phase 1 – Foundation (DONE)
- Synthetic conversation generation
- Pattern + trait extraction
- Benchmark corpus & gap analytics

Phase 2 – Coaching Layer (DONE)
- Percentiles, prescriptions, dashboards, priority list, PDF export

Phase 3 – Real Data Ingestion
- Ingest real meeting transcripts (format adapters)
- Privacy & redaction layer
- Mixed synthetic + real benchmarking

Phase 4 – Semantic Novelty & Drift
- Embedding-based novelty scoring (avoid lexical bias)
- Degradation detection alert if reliability trend slopes down
- Auto-suggest pattern retirement or consolidation

Phase 5 – Live Feedback Loop
- Real-time meeting listener (pattern surfacing prompts)
- “In-the-moment” decision clarity nudge
- Pattern drill tracker

Phase 6 – Platformization
- Public API endpoints (profiles, gaps, prescriptions)
- Team workspace UI
- Multi-team portfolio analytics & permissions

Phase 7 – Optimization & Network Effects
- Cross-team pattern diffusion scoring
- Predictive improvement modeling (“2 drills → +X clarity lift”)
- Marketplace for custom pattern packs
