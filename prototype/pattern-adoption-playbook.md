TooLoo.ai Pattern Adoption Playbook Template

Purpose: Convert coaching prescriptions into actionable habit loops that teams can actually implement and measure.

---

## Pattern Adoption Framework

### Step 1: Prescription Translation
**From**: "Practice option-elimination frameworks"
**To**: Weekly decision drill with structured elimination criteria

**Template**:
- **Gap Identified**: [Trait name] at [percentile] - [specific weakness description]
- **Pattern Prescription**: [TooLoo.ai recommendation]
- **Habit Design**: [Specific weekly/daily practice]
- **Success Metric**: [How you'll know it's working]

## Sample Playbook: Decision Clarity Enhancement

### Baseline Assessment
- **Current State**: Decision process trait at 23rd percentile
- **Symptoms**: Decisions stall, criteria keep shifting, team revisits closed choices
- **Pattern Gap**: Lacks structured option evaluation and elimination

### Prescribed Pattern: Option-Elimination Framework
**Weekly Practice Schedule**:

**Monday**: Decision Inventory
- List all pending decisions (product, strategy, resource allocation)
- Tag by urgency (this week, this month, this quarter)
- Select 1 high-impact decision for structured analysis

**Wednesday**: Framework Application
- Generate 3-5 options for selected decision
- Create weighted criteria matrix (impact, effort, risk, alignment)
- Score each option; eliminate bottom 2
- Document reasoning for elimination

**Friday**: Decision Commit & Document
- Select from remaining options using criteria
- Document: chosen option, eliminated alternatives, decision rationale
- Share with team; set review date for outcome assessment

### Reinforcement Loop
**Bi-Weekly**: Pattern review
- Which decisions used the framework?
- Where did framework prevent stalling/revisiting?
- Adjust criteria weights based on outcome quality

**Monthly**: Re-benchmark
- Generate new product conversation focused on recent decisions
- Check decision clarity percentile improvement
- Celebrate gains; identify next pattern to adopt

## Template for Any Pattern Prescription

### Pattern: [Name]
**Target Trait**: [Vision/Clarity/Risk/Innovation/Execution]
**Current Percentile**: [XX]th
**Target Percentile**: [XX]th (realistic 6-month goal)

**Daily Micro-Practice** (5-10 minutes):
- [Specific daily habit]
- [Trigger/context when to apply]
- [Quick quality check]

**Weekly Deep Practice** (30-45 minutes):
- [Structured application exercise]
- [Documentation/reflection step]
- [Team sharing/feedback component]

**Monthly Assessment**:
- [Self-evaluation questions]
- [Peer feedback collection]
- [Re-benchmark conversation trigger]

**Success Indicators** (leading):
- [Behavioral changes team can observe]
- [Process improvements in meetings/docs]
- [Quality improvements in outputs]

**Success Indicators** (lagging):
- [Percentile improvement in target trait]
- [Overall balance index improvement]
- [Reliability score stabilization]

## Pattern Library Integration

### New Pattern Capture
When team discovers effective practices not in TooLoo.ai library:
1. **Document**: Write conversation showing pattern in action
2. **Validate**: Apply pattern 3+ times with different decisions/contexts
3. **Submit**: Add to TooLoo.ai pattern candidate queue
4. **Feedback**: Track if pattern gets integrated into library

### Pattern Evolution
Track which prescriptions work best for your team:
- **High-Adoption Patterns**: Easy to implement, clear value
- **Low-Adoption Patterns**: Require modification or different approach
- **Custom Variations**: Team-specific adaptations that work better

## Implementation Calendar

**Week 1**: Baseline conversation + trait profiling
**Week 2-3**: Select top gap, design habit loop, start daily practice
**Week 4-5**: Add weekly deep practice, document early wins
**Week 6-7**: Refine habit based on what's working, add team feedback
**Week 8**: Mid-point re-benchmark, assess progress
**Week 9-11**: Scale successful patterns, add second trait focus
**Week 12**: Full re-benchmark, celebrate improvements, plan next cycle

**Quarterly**: Portfolio view across all adopted patterns, library contribution assessment

## Team Dynamics Integration

**Role-Specific Applications**:
- **Product Lead**: Use framework for roadmap decisions, feature prioritization
- **Engineers**: Apply to architecture choices, technical debt decisions  
- **Design**: Structure user research insights, design system decisions
- **Strategy**: Market positioning, competitive response decisions

**Meeting Integration**:
- **Standups**: "What decision am I applying framework to today?"
- **Retros**: "Which pattern helped/hindered this sprint's choices?"
- **Planning**: "Let's use elimination framework for this feature debate"

**Documentation Standard**:
Every major decision includes: options considered, criteria used, elimination reasoning, chosen path, review date set.
