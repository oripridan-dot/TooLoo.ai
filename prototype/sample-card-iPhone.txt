Sample Product Coaching Card – iPhone

Headline Snapshot:
Balanced visionary push, but decision clarity lags. Momentum steady.

Core Scores (simplified):
Vision: High
Risk Handling: Moderate
Decision Clarity: Low
Innovation Drive: High
Execution Discipline: High
Reliability: Mid band
Balance: Mild spread; no dangerous over-concentration.

Top Strength Levers:
- Innovation Drive (sustained reframing)
- Execution Discipline (clear follow-through mechanics)

Primary Growth Gaps:
- Decision Clarity (needs tighter framing of go / no-go moments)
- Structured Risk Narration (surface downside in a neutral, reusable form)

Pattern Drills (do these in next meetings):
1. decision-shorthand-affirm → End strategic debates with a crisp commitment line.
2. criteria-alignment → State 2–3 explicit decision criteria before choosing.
3. risk-surfacing → One neutral sentence naming the key assumption at stake.

Watch List:
None critical, but monitor Vision vs Clarity ratio so ambition doesn’t outrun convergence.

Suggested Next Step:
Run 3 consecutive conversations instrumented with the above drills and re-profile.
