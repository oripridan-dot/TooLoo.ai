TooLoo.ai Capability Map (Plain Language)

1. Conversation Generation / Ingestion
- Reverse-engineers plausible founding/product conversations
- Can plug in real transcripts later

2. Pattern Detection
- Identifies reusable thinking moves (risk surfacing, pivot framing, scope compression)
- Tracks learned vs core patterns

3. Trait & Reliability Profiling
- Scores key cognitive dimensions (vision, clarity, risk, innovation, execution)
- Computes reliability, balance, diversity, novelty

4. Benchmark Intelligence
- 200+ product signatures
- Percentiles + gap deltas vs global & category norms
- Radar-ready vectors

5. Coaching Layer
- Strength / Leverage / Growth / Watch buckets
- Pattern prescriptions (3 drills per weak trait)
- Balance + focus risk alerts

6. Comparative Dashboards
- Single product HTML card (with sparkline trend)
- Multi-product sortable comparison (gaps, reliability, trait)

7. Prioritization & Enablement
- Ranked list of which products/teams to coach first
- PDF coaching packets for share & review

8. Self-Evolving Pattern Library
- Integrates only novel, non-duplicate thinking patterns
- Maintains backups and provenance

9. Incremental Rebuild & Performance
- Recompute only changed product signatures
- Export lightweight JSON artifacts

10. Extensibility Hooks (Future)
- Real conversation ingestion
- Embedding-based semantic novelty
- Time-series degradation alerts
- API endpoints for SaaS embedding
