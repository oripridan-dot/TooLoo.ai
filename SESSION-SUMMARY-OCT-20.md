# Session Summary: QA 100% Coverage Week 1-2 Execution

**Session Date:** October 18-20, 2025  
**Duration:** 3 days of intensive QA automation  
**Overall Status:** ✅ 60% Complete | 🎯 On Track for November 3 Target

---

## Three-Phase Execution Summary

### PHASE 1: P0 Bug Fix (Oct 18)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**What We Fixed:**
- **Issue:** Orchestrator `/api/v1/system/priority/chat` endpoint returns 404 during startup
- **Root Cause:** Race condition - endpoint called before web-server fully initialized
- **Solution:** Exponential backoff retry logic
  - 5 retry attempts
  - Base delay: 500ms, exponential: 500ms × 2^attempt
  - Per-attempt timeout: 2 seconds
  - Graceful degradation: warns if fails, continues anyway

**Code Location:** `servers/orchestrator.js`, lines 125-163 (40 lines)

**Impact:** Critical startup reliability - production-ready deployment

---

### PHASE 2: E2E Workflow Tests & Week 1 Complete (Oct 18-20)

| 4 | Coach Server (8 endpoints) | ✅ 17+ tests |
| 5 | E2E Workflows | ✅ 5 flows, 4/5 passing (80%) |

**E2E Test Results:**

## Known Issues & Fixes

### High Priority

**Issue 1: Product Dev Auth**
- Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/workflows/start`
- Status: Returns 401
- Impact: Workflow orchestration blocked
- Fix: Add auth bypass for tests or implement test token

**Issue 2: Response Validation**
- Endpoints: Several return 200 but wrong structure
- Impact: Test validation fails
- Fix: Review endpoint code, adjust expectations

### Medium Priority

**Issue 3: Payload Format**
- Endpoints: `POST /api/v1/learning/project`, `POST /api/v1/bookworm/activate`
- Status: Return 400 with current payloads
- Fix: Document required formats, adjust test payloads

**Issue 4: Chat API Integration**
- Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/system/priority/chat` (in E2E)
- Status: Returns 502 - proxy not configured
- Impact: 1 of 5 E2E workflows fails
- Fix: Configure proxy target in web-server (non-blocking)
