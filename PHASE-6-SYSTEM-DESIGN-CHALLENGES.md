## 3 Personalized Challenges for YOU

### Challenge #1: Consensus Algorithm Design
**Difficulty**: Intermediate | **Time**: 45 minutes

**Your Scenario**:
> Your company is building a distributed file system that needs to maintain consistent state across 9 data centers. Design a consensus protocol that:
> - Tolerates up to 3 Byzantine node failures
> - Completes elections in <100ms
> - Maintains 99.99% consistency
> - Handles network splits gracefully

**What You'll Learn**:
- Trade-offs between Raft vs Paxos
- Leader election mechanisms
- Network partition recovery
- Consistency guarantees

**Real-World Example**: 
- Kafka uses Raft for controller election
- Zookeeper uses modified Paxos
- etcd uses Raft

**Topics**: Consensus Algorithms, Byzantine Fault Tolerance, Leader Election

---

### Challenge #2: Distributed Transaction Handling
**Difficulty**: Hard | **Time**: 60 minutes

**Your Scenario**:
> You're building a payment system spanning 3 services:
> - Account Service (transfers money)
> - Ledger Service (records transactions)
> - Notification Service (sends confirmation)
> 
> Challenge: Ensure all 3 services complete atomically, or all fail.
> But the network is unreliable. Services can crash mid-transaction.

**What You'll Learn**:
- 2-Phase Commit vs Saga pattern
- Handling partial failures
- Consistency guarantees
- Recovery procedures

**Real-World Example**:
- Uber uses Saga pattern for rides (reservation â†’ payment â†’ confirmation)
- DynamoDB uses 2PC for transactions
- Banking systems use 2PC for cross-account transfers

**Topics**: Distributed Transactions, 2-Phase Commit, Eventual Consistency

---

### Challenge #3: Byzantine Fault Tolerance Design
**Difficulty**: Hard | **Time**: 90 minutes

**Your Scenario**:
> You're designing a cryptocurrency network where:
> - 1000 nodes must agree on transaction order
> - Any node could crash, send wrong data, or act maliciously
> - Network is unreliable (messages can be delayed/lost)
> - You need consensus every 10 seconds

**What You'll Learn**:
- Byzantine resilience formulas (3f+1 nodes)
- Communication complexity (O(nÂ²) problems)
- Detecting malicious behavior
- Finality guarantees

**Real-World Example**:
- Bitcoin uses Proof of Work + longest chain rule
- Ethereum uses Proof of Stake (50% attacker cost to break)
- Cosmos uses 67% supermajority

**Topics**: Byzantine Faults, Fault Tolerance, State Replication
