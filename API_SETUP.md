  -d '{
    "idea": {
      "title": "Your Product Name",
      "problem": "The problem you solve",
      "solution": "Your solution approach",
      "target": "Your target audience"

## What You Get With Real APIs

- 🔍 **Real competitors** from Product Hunt (actual products, pricing, votes)
- 📊 **Real discussions** from Reddit about your market
- 💡 **Better validation** based on actual market data

## Note on Mock Data

The API intelligently falls back to mock data when:
- API rate limits are hit
- Network issues occur
- API keys are invalid

This ensures the app always works smoothly!
