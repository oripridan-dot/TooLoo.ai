  "description": "Student: How do I get better at writing?\n\nMentor: Read widely, write daily, but more importantly - study why good writers make their choices. When you read something beautiful, pause and ask: why did they use that word? What's the rhythm here? \n\nStudent: Is it about following rules?\n\nMentor: Rules are training wheels. Learn them so you know when to break them. Great writing comes from understanding your reader's mind and speaking directly to it. Everything else flows from that empathy.",
