  "description": "Text messaging has become a common, highly effective method for reaching out to and engaging job candidates. Text recruiting is now the norm due partly to the real-time nature of text message conversations and the frequency job candidates respond to texts compared to emails. The following texting templates will help pique the interest of potential job candidates, keep them interested throughout the hiring process and prevent job candidate ghosting. \n\nReady to get started?\n\nSample texting templates for employers\nThe following sample text messages cover a variety of situations in which text messaging is an effective tool for attracting job candidates.\n\n1. Employee referral \nEmployee referrals are one of the best ways to recruit new talent, with 74% of employers saying that candidates who come from employee referrals are high quality. Because the candidate is most likely aware that they’ve been put up for the position, they should be receptive to receiving a recruitment message like this from you:  \n\nHi [recipient’s first name], I am [your full name], a recruiter at [your company name]. Our employee [full name of the person making the referral] thinks you would be a good fit for [open job position] and gave us your contact info. Are you interested in talking more about this opening?\n\n2. Brand-new job opportunity\nWhen opening a new office in a new location, it’s a good idea to tap into your local network for potential new hires. These candidates might not already be aware that you’re opening a new branch there, so a friendly yet professional text message is the right move here.\n\nHi [recipient’s first name], I am [your full name], a recruiter at [your company name]. We are opening a new office in [your location], and we think you might be a good fit for the [job position]. Are you interested in a quick chat to learn more?\n\n3. Job-fair follow-up\nIf you participate in job fairs or other hiring events, you’ll probably walk away with tens if not hundreds of resumes with potential candidates’ phone numbers. Post-event, when you have sifted through the collected resumes, you might want to use the following template to bulk-send text messages. \n\nYou can use this professional text message example for anyone who could be a good fit for a specific role at your company or anyone you simply want to keep on your radar for future job openings.\n\nHello [recipient’s first name]! This is [your full name] from [your company]. It was so nice meeting you at [the hiring event]. We’d love to talk about your interest in [your company] and what you envision for your career. Would you like to schedule 15 minutes sometime soon to have a chat? \n\n4. Candidate who has just been promoted \nWhen a potential job candidate you’ve had your eye on announces a job promotion on social media, it’s a good opportunity to text them a congratulatory message and alert them to apply for a role. \n\nHi [recipient’s first name], I just saw your announcement about your much-deserved promotion. Congrats! I know you’ve just moved up at your company, but a similar role opened up here, and we think you’d be an excellent fit. Do you want to hear more about the position?\n\n5. Potential candidate quoted in an article\nIf you come across an article that quotes someone in your industry and think this person might be a possible fit for a role you have open, this is a great reason to contact them. Even if they’re not interested in the current open role, you can establish a rapport with them and contact them again if another opportunity arises in the future.\n\nHey [recipient’s first name]! I read [the article the recipient is quoted in], and I loved what you had to say. Have you ever considered working with us at [your company]? We’re looking to hire someone for [job position]. Are you open to talking with us more? \n\n6. Reengaging a previous job applicant\nSometimes a job candidate isn’t a great fit for a certain role, but when another opening comes up, you recall them and think they might align with this new opening. This is a perfect reason to reengage this person via text message. This sample text message should do the trick.\n\nHi [recipient’s first name], this is [your full name] from [your company]. You had applied for our [previous job position that recipient applied for]. While that wasn’t a mutual fit, we would like to discuss our [current open position] with you. Would you be interested in this role?\n\n7. Screening job applicants\nIf you have several great candidates for a job, there may be certain applicants you’re interested in but aren’t sure if they warrant an interview. Performing an interview with multiple candidates can be very time-consuming, so you have to be selective. A great intermediate step before scheduling a formal interview is asking the applicant to answer a few questions via text message.  \n\nHello [recipient’s first name], I’m [your full name] from [your company]. We have received your application for [open job position]. Part of our interview process involves asking a few questions over text messages. Short answers are fine, and you can answer whenever you have time today. Are you willing to participate?\n\n8. Scheduling a job interview\nEmails to job applicants can get lost in the shuffle, or a candidate’s spam filter can inadvertently block them. You can cut through the clutter by texting a job applicant about setting up a time to schedule an interview.   \n\nHello [recipient’s first name], I’m [your full name] from [your company]. Thank you for applying for [open job position]. We’d love to conduct an initial interview with you over Zoom. Can you send some 30-minute windows that are free for you for this week? \n\n9. Following up after a job interview\nAfter an interview, it’s important to stay in touch with the job applicant, especially if you’re interviewing multiple candidates and the process is taking a while. Applicants are understandably anxious to hear back following an interview, so it’s courteous to keep them current on your progress. Here’s a sample text message that politely requests that the job candidate bears with you while the process plays out. \n\nHello [recipient’s first name]. It was great meeting you the other day in our interview. I just wanted to let you know that we’re still in the middle of the hiring process and that we’ll be in touch again with an update and any next steps by [day of the week you choose]. Thanks again! \n\nInterview Text Messages for Employers Templates for PDF & Word\nUse these texting templates to pique the interest of potential job candidates and keep them interested throughout the process.",
