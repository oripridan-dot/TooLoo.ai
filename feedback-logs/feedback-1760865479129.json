  "description": "Manager: How would you approach this scaling problem?\n\nEngineer: Well, first I'd understand the current bottleneck. Is it CPU, memory, or I/O? I'd profile in production, then look at three angles: can we optimize the current architecture? Can we add caching? Or do we need to redesign?\n\nManager: What if optimization takes too long?\n\nEngineer: I'd prioritize by impact. Get 80% of the gains first, then iterate. Quick wins with caching or indexes might buy us time while we design the real solution. I prefer incremental improvements you can measure.",
