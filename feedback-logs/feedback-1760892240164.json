  "description": "Hiring Manager: We interviewed three candidates for the senior role. I'm torn between two. Can you help me think through this?\n\nHR Manager: Tell me about each one. Not just credentials - walk me through what they said, how they approached the questions, what mattered to them.\n\nHiring Manager: Candidate A said she'd optimize processes. Candidate B talked about understanding the team first before making changes. Candidate C was eager to implement a new framework immediately.\n\nHR Manager: That tells me something important. Let me ask: when you asked about handling conflict, what did each person say? Did they go straight to solutions, or did they ask questions first?\n\nHiring Manager: A went to solutions immediately. B asked clarifying questions about context. C wanted to know the framework first.\n\nHR Manager: That's revealing. A is solution-focused and confident - great for quick wins but might miss nuance. B is curious and contextual - slower decisions but better cultural fit. C wants structure and process - good for organization but might struggle with ambiguity. Which one fits what you need in year one vs. year three?\n\nHiring Manager: That's a good frame. I hadn't thought about timeline.\n\nHR Manager: Most people don't. We promote people based on how they'd be great in a different role than the one they're interviewing for. But success is about match - person, role, stage, team, culture. I'd look at: Does this person naturally think about impact on others? Do they iterate or decide fast? Do they bring people along or assume you'll follow? What assumptions guide their decisions?\n\nHiring Manager: How do I assess that?\n\nHR Manager: From what they naturally talk about. If they mention \"I realized I was wrong\" and explain what they learned, they're reflective. If they only talk about wins, they might not have a growth mindset. If they ask about the culture, they're thinking about fit. If they only ask about the title and comp, they're seeing this as a transaction.\n\nHiring Manager: And if I'm still uncertain?\n\nHR Manager: Then run a working trial on a real problem. See how they think through ambiguity. See if they pull others in or go solo. See if they ask before acting or act before understanding. One conversation reveals patterns, but behavior reveals character.",
