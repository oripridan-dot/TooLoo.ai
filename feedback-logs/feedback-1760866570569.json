  "description": "Friend: How did you decide on this art direction?\n\nArtist: I started by feeling what emotion I wanted to evoke, then played with colors and shapes until something clicked. I didn't have a plan - I let the canvas tell me what it needed. It's like conversation with the medium itself.\n\nFriend: Did you struggle with it?\n\nArtist: Constantly. But struggle is part of the dialogue. I iterate based on intuition, not rules. Sometimes the \"mistakes\" become the best parts.",
