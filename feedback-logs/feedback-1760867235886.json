  "description": "Manager: We're getting performance complaints. What's your approach?\n\nEngineer: First, let me understand the scope. Are we talking about latency, throughput, or both? On which operations? I'd pull metrics from production, profile the hot spots, then analyze three angles: can we optimize within current architecture? Can we add caching layers? Or do we need fundamental redesign?\n\nManager: Timeline is tight. How do you prioritize?\n\nEngineer: I separate the work into: quick wins (30% improvement in 1 day), medium-term (60% in a week), and long-term redesign (80%+ in a month). I'd tackle quick wins first - maybe optimize N+1 queries, add Redis caching for hot data, batch certain operations. That buys time while we design the real solution.\n\nManager: How confident are you in these estimates?\n\nEngineer: Based on similar past work, I'm pretty confident about quick wins. The 60% and 80% targets depend on what the profiling shows. That's why the first step - actually measuring - is crucial. I can't optimize blind.\n\nManager: What if we're wrong about what's slow?\n\nEngineer: Exactly why we profile first. I've learned that assumptions about performance are usually wrong. The bottleneck is rarely where people guess. Once we measure, we'll know exactly where to focus.",
