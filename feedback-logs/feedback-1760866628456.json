  "description": "Publisher: What's the theme of your story?\n\nWriter: It started as a question: what if someone discovered they'd been wrong about something fundamental? The whole narrative grew from exploring that discomfort. I follow my characters' logic - they make choices, I write the consequences.\n\nPublisher: Do you plan the ending?\n\nWriter: Not really. I know the emotional arc, but the specific path emerges as I write. The best moments surprise me too. I trust the process more than the plan.",
