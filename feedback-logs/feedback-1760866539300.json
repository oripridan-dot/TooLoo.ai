  "description": "Manager: How would you approach this scaling problem?\n\nEngineer: First I'd understand the bottleneck - is it CPU, memory, or I/O? I'd profile in production, then look at three angles: optimize the current architecture, add caching, or redesign. \n\nManager: What if optimization takes too long?\n\nEngineer: I'd prioritize by impact. Get 80% gains first, then iterate. Quick wins with caching might buy us time while we design the real solution. I prefer incremental improvements you can measure.",
