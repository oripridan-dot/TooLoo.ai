  "description": "Interviewer: Walk me through your creative process for this series.\n\nArtist: I started with a feeling - this tension between control and chaos. I didn't sketch or plan. I just started making marks, watching what emerged. Early pieces were awkward, but that awkwardness told me something important about what I was trying to express. So I leaned into it.\n\nInterviewer: Did you know what you wanted before you started?\n\nArtist: No, that's the thing. I had a vague emotional landscape, but the work teaches me what I actually want to say. It's almost like negotiation with the materials. I try something, the paint responds in a way I didn't expect, and now I'm pursuing that surprise. Sometimes my \"mistakes\" are the most honest moments.\n\nInterviewer: How do you know when something's finished?\n\nArtist: When it stops arguing with me. When all the elements feel like they're in conversation rather than conflict. It's very intuitive - not a checklist thing. Some pieces took weeks, others were done in a day. The time doesn't matter. The rightness does.\n\nInterviewer: Right for whom?\n\nArtist: For me, first. But then, for the viewer who hasn't seen it yet. There's this balance - it needs to be true to my vision, but open enough for someone else to find themselves in it. Too controlled and it's boring. Too loose and it's just noise.",
