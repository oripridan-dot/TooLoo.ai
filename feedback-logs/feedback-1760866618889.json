  "description": "Colleague: Why did our conversion rate drop?\n\nAnalyst: I looked at three dimensions: traffic source, device type, and time period. Conversion dropped 8% overall, but it's concentrated in mobile traffic from paid ads. When I segment by geography, the US is down 15%, Europe steady, Asia up.\n\nColleague: So it's the traffic source?\n\nAnalyst: Not necessarily. Could be the audience, the ad creative, or a platform change. Let me test by controlling one variable at a time. I want to isolate the true driver with confidence intervals.",
