## Phased Evolution Path
| Phase | Focus | Key Win Condition |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| P1 | Flexible doc + database primitives | Users build custom tables & link them |
| P2 | Collaboration + real-time presence | Teams adopt as shared source of truth |
| P3 | API & integrations | External systems sync reliably |
| P4 | Template marketplace & ecosystem | Network effects via community modules |
| P5 | Intelligence layer (AI assist) | Contextual suggestions & automation |

## Core Conversation Arcs (Condensed)
1. Fragmentation Problem â†’ Teams juggle docs, tasks, sheets; context fractured.  
2. Primitive Strategy â†’ Provide Lego-like blocks (pages, databases, relations).  
3. Adoption Wedge â†’ Start with personal notes â†’ graduate to team wiki & sprint hub.  
4. Ecosystem Unlock â†’ API + marketplace to let community extend.  
5. Intelligence Future â†’ Semantic linking, summarization, automated backfill.

## Execution Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Type | Mitigation |
|------|------|------------|
| Feature creep | Product | Guardrails: primitive-first acceptance test | 
| Performance drag | Technical | Structured profiling budget per release | 
| Marketplace quality variance | Ecosystem | Rating & safety review pipeline | 
| Onboarding overwhelm | UX | Progressive disclosure of advanced features | 

## Strategic Moats
1. Knowledge Graph Emergence (implicit links)  
2. Community Template Network  
3. Unified Data Primitive (relations across use cases)  
4. AI-Augmented Authoring History  

## Initial Backlog Seeds (Sample)
| Epic | Story Stub | Value | Effort |
|------|-----------|-------|--------|
| Database UX | Inline relation quick-create | High | M |
| Sync Engine | Conflict resolution model v1 | High | H |
| Performance | Virtualized list rendering | Medium | M |
| AI Layer | Context summary panel | Medium | M |
| Ecosystem | Template quality rating | High | L |
