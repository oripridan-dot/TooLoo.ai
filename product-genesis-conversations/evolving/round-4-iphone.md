Excerpt:
> [problem-framing] Market: We keep tripping over the same core user friction around iPhone.
> [problem-framing] Market: The root dysfunction isn't surface UX—it's workflow fragmentation in how iPhone is approached.
> [problem-framing] TechLead: The root dysfunction isn't surface UX—it's workflow fragmentation in how iPhone is approached. (increasingly aligned)
> [option-divergence] Product: Let's map incremental -> transitional -> disruptive arcs and stress their latency vs adoption curves.
> [option-divergence] TechLead: We have three strategic vectors: conservative polish, hybrid augmentation, and radical redefinition of iPhone.
