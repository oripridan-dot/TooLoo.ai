Excerpt:
> [problem-framing] Market: The root dysfunction isn't surface UX—it's workflow fragmentation in how Tesla is approached.
> [problem-framing] Founder: The root dysfunction isn't surface UX—it's workflow fragmentation in how Tesla is approached. (increasingly aligned)
> [problem-framing] Market: We keep tripping over the same core user friction around Tesla.
> [option-divergence] Founder: We have three strategic vectors: conservative polish, hybrid augmentation, and radical redefinition of Tesla. (increasingly aligned)
> [option-divergence] Founder: Let's map incremental -> transitional -> disruptive arcs and stress their latency vs adoption curves. (increasingly aligned)
