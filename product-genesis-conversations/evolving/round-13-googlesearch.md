## Improvement Plan
- Add depth in phase 'problem-framing' via explicit trade-off articulation.
- Seed language to elevate traits: decisionClarity.
- Introduce at least one novel structural element (meta reflection, user empathy splice).

## Enrichment
- No new patterns adopted

## Metrics
- Coverage: 87.5%
