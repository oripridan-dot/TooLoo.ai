Excerpt:
> [problem-framing] Product: We keep tripping over the same core user friction around adaptive orchestration layer.
> [problem-framing] Ops: The root dysfunction isn't surface UX—it's workflow fragmentation in how adaptive orchestration layer is approached. (aligned)
> [problem-framing] Market: We keep tripping over the same core user friction around adaptive orchestration layer.
> [problem-framing] TechLead: We keep tripping over the same core user friction around adaptive orchestration layer.
> [option-divergence] Market: We have three strategic vectors: conservative polish, hybrid augmentation, and radical redefinition of NovaPlatform.
