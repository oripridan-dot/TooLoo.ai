- strategicVision: 54.5%
- riskIntelligence: 90.9%
- decisionClarity: 44.4%
- innovationDrive: 57.1%
- executionDiscipline: 88.9%

## Improvement Plan
- Add depth in phase 'problem-framing' via explicit trade-off articulation.
- Seed language to elevate traits: decisionClarity.
- Introduce at least one novel structural element (meta reflection, user empathy splice).

## Enrichment
- No new patterns adopted

## Metrics
- Coverage: 87.5%
- Avg Confidence: 78.7%
- Trait Mean: 67.2%
- Novelty: 0.0%
- Reliability Score: 78.5%

Excerpt:
> [problem-framing] TechLead: We keep tripping over the same core user friction around iPhone.
> [problem-framing] Market: We keep tripping over the same core user friction around iPhone.
> [problem-framing] Product: The root dysfunction isn't surface UX—it's workflow fragmentation in how iPhone is approached.
> [problem-framing] TechLead: We keep tripping over the same core user friction around iPhone.
> [option-divergence] Founder: We have three strategic vectors: conservative polish, hybrid augmentation, and radical redefinition of iPhone. (increasingly aligned)
