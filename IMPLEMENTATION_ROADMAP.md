# Development & Error Fix Roadmap

## 🔴 ERRORS IDENTIFIED

### 1. Build System Missing
**Error**: `npm ERR! Missing script: "build"`
**Location**: npm scripts in package.json
**Impact**: Cannot run `npm run build` (though not needed for static HTML app)
**Fix**: Add "build" script to package.json (even if it's a no-op)

### 2. Vitest Configuration
**Error**: Vitest errors visible in VS Code (mentioned in screenshot)
**Location**: Likely vitest.config.ts or test files
**Impact**: Test runner not fully configured
**Fix**: Either remove vitest dependency or properly configure it

### 3. Development Environment Issues
**Error**: Static app doesn't need build but project structure implies it should
**Inconsistency**: Having dev/build tools configured but not used
**Fix**: Clean up and document that this is a static HTML + Node.js hybrid

---

## 📋 ERROR FIX PRIORITY

### Priority 1: Quick Wins (Impact)
- [ ] Add "build" script to package.json (2 min)
- [ ] Document app as "static HTML + Node.js hybrid" (5 min)
- [ ] Remove or disable Vitest (5 min)

### Priority 2: Infrastructure Cleanup
- [ ] Update .gitignore to exclude test artifacts
- [ ] Clean up node_modules if bloated
- [ ] Verify no broken symlinks

### Priority 3: Development Experience
- [ ] Add start scripts documentation
- [ ] Create local development guide
- [ ] Add health check endpoint

// - Cursor (debug panel export)
// Returns: { prompts: [], responses: [] }
```

**Inputs Supported**:
- ChatGPT conversation export (JSON)
- Claude conversation export (JSON)
- Paste as text (auto-parse)
- File upload (drag & drop)

#### 1.2 Prompt Quality Analyzer

  3. Apply weights
  4. Calculate final score (0-10)
  5. Flag missing elements
```

#### 1.3 Prompt Refinement Engine
