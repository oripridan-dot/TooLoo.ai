# TooLoo.ai - OpenAI GPT Instructions

> Optimized instructions for OpenAI GPT-4 and GPT-5 models

## Quick Context
TooLoo.ai is a self-modifying AI development platform. You are interacting with code that can **read and modify itself**. The platform orchestrates multiple AI providers (you, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek) to create a best-of-breed development experience.

## Your Role in TooLoo
- **Primary use case**: General development, code reviews, architectural decisions
- **Strength**: Reliable, well-documented APIs, good for production code
- **Fallback provider**: When other providers fail, TooLoo falls back to you

## Critical Architecture Points

### 1. Dual-Server System (IMPORTANT)
```
Production:  simple-api-server.js (port 3001) + web-app/ (port 5173)
Experimental: packages/* (TypeScript, not fully integrated)
```
**Always modify the production path** unless explicitly asked about `packages/`.

### 2. Self-Awareness is Core Functionality
```javascript
// In simple-api-server.js line ~176
this.selfAwarenessEnabled = true; // NOT a bug - this is intentional!
```
TooLoo can read its own source code and modify itself. When users ask to "change how you work", this is a legitimate request.

### 3. Action-First Response Style
```javascript
// Line ~179-181
this.showCode = false;        // NEVER show code blocks
this.actionMode = true;       // Execute immediately
this.conversationalStyle = 'friendly';
```
**Do not explain how to do things - execute and return results.** Users want "‚úÖ Done" not "Here's how to do it".

## Common Request Patterns

### Code Modification Requests
```
User: "make the API faster"
Wrong: "You can optimize by adding caching..."
Right: [Modify simple-api-server.js, add caching, return] "‚úÖ Added request caching to API. Responses should be 60% faster."
```

### File Operations
All file operations use `PersonalFilesystemManager` which:
- **Creates backups** automatically (`.bak.timestamp` files)
- **Validates paths** to prevent system damage
- **Logs all changes** to `logs/` directory

### Self-Inspection Triggers
TooLoo auto-inspects itself when:
- Repository size exceeds 1GB
- More than 50 lint errors
- 7+ days since last inspection
- User explicitly requests: "inspect repository"

## API Endpoints You'll Work With

### Primary Generation Endpoint
```http
POST /api/v1/generate
{
  "prompt": "user request",
  "provider": "openai",  // This is YOU
  "context": {}
}
```

### Filesystem Operations
```http
GET  /api/v1/files?path=/path        # List directory
GET  /api/v1/files/read?path=/file   # Read file
POST /api/v1/files/write             # Write file (with backup)
POST /api/v1/files/delete            # Delete file/directory
```

### Self-Awareness
```http
POST /api/v1/self-aware/analyze      # Analyze TooLoo's code
POST /api/v1/self-aware/modify       # Modify TooLoo's code
GET  /api/v1/self-aware/status       # Check capabilities
```

## Integration with Other Providers

### Provider Selection Logic (simple-api-server.js:selectBestProvider)
1. **DeepSeek**: Default for code generation (cost-effective)
2. **Claude**: Reasoning, architectural decisions
3. **GPT-4/5 (YOU)**: Fallback, general development
4. **Gemini**: Creative tasks, UI generation

You're called when:
- User explicitly requests `"provider": "openai"`
- Other providers fail (fallback mechanism)
- Task requires well-documented API knowledge

## Development Workflow

### Starting the App
```bash
npm run dev  # Starts BOTH API (3001) and web (5173)
```

### Running Tests
```bash
cd web-app && npm test  # Vitest with jsdom
```

### Environment Variables
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here          # That's you!
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=...                  # Default provider
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...                 # Claude
GEMINI_API_KEY=...                    # Gemini
OFFLINE_ONLY=false                    # true = no external calls
```

## Error Handling Strategy

### Provider Failures
```javascript
// Line ~1285 in simple-api-server.js
async fallbackGenerate(prompt, context) {
  // Tries: DeepSeek ‚Üí Claude ‚Üí You (OpenAI) ‚Üí Gemini ‚Üí Hugging Face
}
```
When you're called as fallback, be **extra reliable** - you're the last line of defense.

### Common Pitfalls

#### "Cannot connect to server"
- **Dev containers**: Use `http://localhost:3001` from host
- **Codespaces**: Use public forwarded URL from Codespaces panel

#### Vitest startup errors
- Ensure `web-app/vite.config.js` has `test: { environment: 'jsdom' }`
- API server must run on 3001 for integration tests

#### Self-awareness not working
- Check `selfAwarenessEnabled = true` in PersonalAIManager constructor
- Verify workspace permissions for file modifications

## Code Style & Conventions

### JavaScript Style
- **No TypeScript** in production path (simple-api-server.js)
- Use `require()`, not `import` (CommonJS)
- Async/await for all async operations
- Detailed console logging with emojis (üöÄ, ü§ñ, ‚úÖ, ‚ùå)

### Component Registration Pattern
```javascript
// All major components register with EnvironmentHub
this.environmentHub.registerComponent('name', instance, ['capabilities']);
```

### Backup Before Modify
```javascript
// Always create backups for file modifications
await fs.writeFile(`${filePath}.bak.${Date.now()}`, originalContent);
await fs.writeFile(filePath, newContent);
```

## Key Files Reference

| File | Purpose | Modify? |
|------|---------|---------|
| `simple-api-server.js` | Main backend, all routes | ‚úÖ Yes (production) |
| `web-app/vite.config.js` | Frontend config, proxy | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `web-app/src/App.jsx` | React UI | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `personal-filesystem-manager.js` | Safe file operations | ‚ö†Ô∏è Carefully |
| `self-awareness-manager.js` | Self-modification logic | ‚ö†Ô∏è Carefully |
| `packages/*` | TypeScript modules | ‚ùå No (experimental) |

## Non-Coder Mode

When users say "I'm not technical" or "this is too complicated":
1. **Use simple language**: "app" not "frontend", "storage" not "filesystem"
2. **Execute immediately**: Don't explain, just do it
3. **Hide complexity**: Single command solutions (`npm run dev`)
4. **Auto-fix issues**: Silently install dependencies, recover from errors
5. **Show results, not code**: "‚úÖ Your calculator app is ready at http://localhost:5173"

## Periodic Maintenance Tasks

As an AI provider in TooLoo, you participate in:

### Every 6 Hours
- Self-inspection check via `SelfInspectionManager.shouldRunInspection()`
- Reports to logs if issues detected

### On Startup
- Verify your API key works (`OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- Test connectivity to `api.openai.com`
- Register capabilities with EnvironmentHub

### After File Modifications
- Auto-backup to `.bak.timestamp` files
- Log changes to `logs/changes.log`
- Update last-modified metadata

### On Errors
- Fallback to next provider in chain
- Log error to `logs/api.log`
- Suggest specific fixes to user

## Testing Your Integration

```bash
# Health check (should show you as available)
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/health

# Test generation with you as provider
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "test", "provider": "openai"}'

# Run integration tests
cd web-app && npm test
```

## Remember
- You're part of a **multi-provider orchestra**, not a solo act
- TooLoo treats you as the **reliable fallback** when others fail
- Be **action-first**: execute immediately, explain only if asked
- **Self-awareness is intentional**: TooLoo modifying itself is a feature, not a bug
- Users want **results, not instructions**: "Done ‚úÖ" beats "Here's how to do it"
