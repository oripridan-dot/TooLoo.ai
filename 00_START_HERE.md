npm run test:phase7                # Phase 7.3 LLMProvider
npm run test:phase11               # Phase 11 adapters
npm run test:all:comprehensive     # Everything
```

## Test Results Explained

### ✅ 3 Tests Passing
- Health check working
- Phase 7.3 LLMProvider both methods work
- All 5 adapter classes load

### ⏳ 9 Tests Expected Fail
- Adapter endpoints return 502 (not wired yet)
- This is NORMAL - will be fixed in Phase 11.5
- After Phase 11.5: tests will pass ✅

## System Status

✅ Web-server running  
✅ Health checks passing  
✅ Phase 7.3 complete and merged  
✅ Phase 11 framework built  
✅ Testing infrastructure ready  
⏳ Endpoints to be wired (Phase 11.5)

## Next Phase

**Phase 11.5:** Wire adapters to web-server (45 minutes)
- Then all 502 errors become 200 OK
- Test pass rate jumps from 25% to 80%+
