• "Analyze the codebase"
• "What can you do?"
```

### 📚 Option 2: Read the Documentation
```bash
# Start here (5 min read)
cat START_HERE.md

# Then your action plan (3 min)
cat NEXT_STEPS.md

# System status (3 min)
cat SYSTEM_STATUS.md
```

### 🧪 Option 3: Run the Tests
```bash
cd web-app
npm test

# You should see:
# ✓ 5 tests passing
```

### 📊 Option 4: Check System Status
```bash
# Health check
npm run health
