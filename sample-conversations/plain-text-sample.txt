Alex: I've been analyzing our customer feedback, and there's a clear pattern emerging.
Jordan: What kind of pattern? Good or concerning?
Alex: Mixed, but definitely something we should address. Customers love the core features but find the interface confusing.
Jordan: That's actually really valuable feedback. Do we have specific examples of what's confusing?
Alex: Yes, mainly the navigation and the way we present options. People want simpler, more direct paths to what they need.
Jordan: Makes sense. Should we prioritize a UI overhaul or focus on incremental improvements?
Alex: I think incremental is smarter. We can test changes with small groups first and see what works.
Jordan: Good approach. Can you put together a plan with the top 3 issues to tackle first?
