## ⚠️ CONTINGENCY PROCEDURES

### If Rollout Encounters Issues

```
SEVERITY: Critical (error rate >0.5%)
├─ Immediate: Reduce to 50% traffic (maintain stability)
├─ Investigation: Root cause analysis (2-hour window)
├─ Decision: Fix (24 hours) or redesign (3-5 days)
└─ Next attempt: Nov 3 or Nov 6

SEVERITY: High (error rate 0.1-0.5%)
├─ Monitor: Intensive observation (2-hour window)
├─ Decision: Continue or investigate
├─ Path: If continues, likely temporary spike (continue)
└─ If degrading: Reduce traffic, investigate

SEVERITY: Low (minor anomalies)
├─ Monitor: Standard monitoring
├─ Action: Log & track
└─ Resolution: Address in Sprint 3 optimization
```

### If Rollout Delayed

```
If ramp phase fails (NO-GO Nov 1):
├─ Delay: Reschedule rollout for Nov 3 or Nov 6
├─ Investigation: Root cause analysis & fix (24-48 hours)
├─ Sprint 3: Delay by same amount
├─ Impact: Minimal (rescheduled, not cancelled)

If rollout encounters blockers Nov 2:
├─ Delay: Hold rollout, continue investigation
├─ Decision: Proceed Nov 3 or proceed with caution (50% traffic)
├─ Sprint 3: May launch slightly delayed, otherwise unaffected
└─ Business impact: Slight delay to ROI realization
```

### If Sprint 3 Encounters Issues

```
Stream 1 Blocked:
├─ Impact: -3-5% ROI delay, not critical
├─ Resolution: Pivot focus to Stream 2 features
├─ Contingency: Re-attempt Stream 1 in Phase 4

Stream 2 Blocked:
├─ Impact: -4-6% engagement, could affect churn metric
├─ Resolution: Prioritize Stream 3 (scale-out prevents issues)
├─ Contingency: Simplify features, launch subset

Stream 3 Blocked:
├─ Impact: 99.99% uptime not achieved by Nov 30
├─ Resolution: Extend Stream 3 into Phase 4
├─ Contingency: Maintain 99.95% uptime as interim goal
```
