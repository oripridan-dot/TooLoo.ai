Show HN: TooLoo ‚Äì Extract thinking patterns from any conversation using AI
```

**URL:** 
```
https://neat-mayfly-54.loca.lt
```

**Text:**
```
I built TooLoo.ai ‚Äì a free tool that analyzes conversations to extract how people think through problems.

The idea came from noticing that understanding someone's reasoning framework is harder than getting answers. ChatGPT helps, but you need perfect prompts. TooLoo is purpose-built for this.

How it works:
- Upload/paste any conversation (text, email, chat logs, interviews)
- AI analyzes it to extract thinking patterns, reasoning frameworks, decision models
- Get instant insights: "How does this person prioritize?" "What's their problem-solving approach?"

Use cases:
- Understand how your team thinks (better collaboration)
- Learn reasoning patterns from mentors or great thinkers
- Analyze customer conversations (insight into what they really want)
- Self-reflection (how do I actually think through problems?)

It's early beta but fully functional. Uses Claude + OpenAI under the hood. Would love feedback from the HN community.

**Text:**
```
Hey r/MachineLearning! I built TooLoo.ai, a free tool that analyzes conversations to extract thinking patterns and reasoning frameworks.

**The Problem:** Understanding *how* someone thinks is harder than getting their answers. ChatGPT helps but you need the right prompts.

**The Solution:** TooLoo is purpose-built for pattern extraction. Upload a conversation ‚Üí get instant insights into:
- Decision-making frameworks
- Problem-solving approaches
- Reasoning patterns
- Knowledge structures

**Use Cases:**
- Analyze interviews to understand candidate thinking
- Extract knowledge from mentor conversations
- Study how experts approach problems
- Understand customer needs (beyond surface requests)

**Under the Hood:**
- Uses Claude + OpenAI for analysis
- Runs locally (no data storage)
- Free during beta
- Open to feedback on model choices and prompt engineering

The tool is live and fully functional. Would love feedback from this community on model selection, prompt effectiveness, and what insights you'd want to extract.

Using GPT + Claude to extract thinking patterns from conversations (new tool)
```

**Text:**
```
Built a tool that uses both Claude and GPT to analyze conversations and extract thinking patterns.

The idea: ChatGPT is great at answering questions, but understanding *how someone thinks* requires more than Q&A. 

So I built TooLoo ‚Äì paste a conversation, get instant insights into reasoning frameworks, decision patterns, problem-solving approaches.

**Features:**
- Dual-model analysis (Claude for depth, GPT for speed)
- Real-time insights
- No data storage (privacy-first)
- Free during beta

**Use cases:**
- Extract expertise from mentors
- Analyze team communication patterns
- Understand customer needs deeply
- Self-reflection on your own thinking

Would love feedback on model selection, prompt effectiveness, and what patterns matter most to you.

```
Free tool to understand how productive people think (by analyzing their conversations)
```

**Text:**
```
Built a free tool called TooLoo that analyzes conversations to extract thinking patterns.

**The insight:** Productivity isn't just about tools‚Äîit's about thinking frameworks. The best way to adopt better frameworks is to reverse-engineer how great thinkers actually think.

**How it works:**
- Paste a conversation (email, chat, interview, etc.)
- AI extracts thinking patterns and decision frameworks
- Learn their approach, copy their thinking

**Perfect for:**
- Understanding how mentors prioritize
- Analyzing your own decision-making (self-reflection)
- Learning team collaboration patterns
- Extracting "expert intuition" into actionable frameworks

Early beta, fully free. Would love your feedback.
