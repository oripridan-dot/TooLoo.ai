## 🚀 Next Session: Real API Integration

When you're ready to continue, we'll:

1. **Create Express backend server**
   - RESTful API endpoints
   - Connect to market intelligence engine
   - Handle CORS for dev

2. **Wire up React frontend**
   - Replace mock data with real API calls
   - Error handling
   - Loading states

3. **Test end-to-end flow**
   - Enter idea → Real Product Hunt search → Real Reddit analysis
   - Live validation scoring
   - Actual competitor data

## 💡 Key Insight

**This is no longer a "coding tool."**

It's a **visual business intelligence platform** that happens to be powered by AI and code.

You can show this to non-technical people and they'll understand it immediately.

**That's the transformation.** 🎉
