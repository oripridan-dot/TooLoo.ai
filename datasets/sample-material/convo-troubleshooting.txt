[Troubleshooting Session]
User: Getting repeated 502 errors on image upload edge node.
Assistant: Checking likely causes: cold start, oversized payload, or regional latency.
User: Payloads are small ~120KB.
Assistant: That rules out size. Any spike in latency metrics?
User: p95 jumped from 220ms to 1900ms in eu-central.
Assistant: Suggest isolating: force traffic shift to secondary region and warm containers.
User: Did region failover — errors drop to near zero.
Assistant: Indicates degraded edge cluster — likely transient infrastructure issue.
User: Need a postmortem scaffold.
Assistant: Drafting sections: Timeline, Impact, Root Cause Hypothesis, Mitigations, Follow-ups.
User: Add hypothesis: container image layer fetch thrash.
Assistant: Noted.
User: Add mitigation: pre-warm image layers via periodic keep-alive.
Assistant: Added.
User: Add follow-up: add synthetic upload canary.
Assistant: Logged.
