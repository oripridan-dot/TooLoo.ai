[Mixed Long Conversation]
User: Starting broad â€” want a unified cognitive + behavioral profile pipeline.
Assistant: Noted. We can stage: ingestion -> normalization -> segmentation -> pattern extraction -> trait synthesis.
User: Ingestion sources initially: Slack export, raw text paste, maybe Discord.
Assistant: We'll create adapters returning canonical {role, content, timestamp}.
User: Normalization concerns: system messages, bots, formatting noise.
Assistant: We'll strip system/bot lines, collapse multi-line user blocks.
User: Segmentation baseline approach?
Assistant: Hybrid: role transition heuristic + semantic drift threshold.
User: Pattern extraction first pass heuristic?
Assistant: Frequency + co-occurrence + imperative verb detection for behavior intents.
User: Trait synthesis initial dimensions?
Assistant: Focus, Exploration, Decisiveness, Supportiveness.
User: Need evaluation harness early.
Assistant: We'll build ground-truth JSON, prediction JSON, then compute precision/recall.
User: Risk: overfitting to tiny sample.
Assistant: Mitigate with holdout synthetic blends + incremental real data.
User: Add drift monitoring thought.
Assistant: Track vector centroid shift across weekly windows.
User: Provide concise milestone ladder.
Assistant: M0 ingestion+segmentation, M1 patterns, M2 traits, M3 evaluation+drift, M4 dashboard.
User: Summarize status format for weekly updates.
Assistant: Template: Progress, Risks, Next, Blockers.
