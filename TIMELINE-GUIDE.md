# 🎯 Event-Based Timeline Guide

## What This Is

A **DAW-style version control system** where you save meaningful milestones, not arbitrary time intervals.

---

## 🎨 How It Works

### Manual Milestones (You Control)
**Cmd+Shift+M** - Mark a milestone

**When to use:**
- ✅ Task completed
- 🔀 Decision point reached
- 🎨 Working version achieved
- 🐛 Before major change
- 🚀 Milestone reached

**Prompts you for:**
1. Milestone name: "Workspace cleaned"
2. What was accomplished: "Deleted 43 files, 162MB freed"

**Creates:**
- Git commit with context
- Timeline entry
- Searchable history

---

### Smart Suggestions (I Help)
**Automatic detection of:**
- Major file changes (>5 files)
- Completed tasks (todos marked done)
- New features working
- Tests passing

**I suggest:** "Save this as milestone?"
**You decide:** Yes/No

---

### Timeline View
**Cmd+Shift+H** - Show timeline

**Example output:**
```
🎯 Event-Based Timeline:

🧹 Workspace cleaned

   Git: e18d8e7 (v2-idea-workshop)
   Context: {"deleted": 43, "freed": "162MB"}

📋 Copilot instructions complete
   Oct 5, 2025, 10:36 PM
   Git: a3f9c21 (v2-idea-workshop)
   Context: {"lines": 741, "features": "TooLoo Mode"}

🎯 TooLoo Mode activated

## ⌨️ Commands

## 🎯 Workflow Examples

### After Completing Task
```
1. Task done ✅
2. Cmd+Shift+M
3. Name: "Budget system working"
4. Accomplished: "Added tracking, caching, limits"
5. ✅ Milestone saved
```

### At Decision Point
```
1. About to try new approach
2. Cmd+Shift+M
3. Name: "Before nuclear clean"
4. Accomplished: "Working state, trying cleanup"
5. ✅ Safe to experiment
```

### When I Suggest
```
Me: "💡 Detected major changes. Save milestone?"
You: "Yes"
Me: Cmd+Shift+M (auto-opens)
You: Name it
✅ Saved
```

## 🔄 Comparison: Time-Based vs Event-Based

### Time-Based (❌ What We Don't Want)
```
auto-save: README.md (23:15:30)
auto-save: README.md (23:16:00)
auto-save: settings.json (23:16:30)
auto-save: README.md (23:17:00)
```
**Noise, no meaning, hard to navigate**

### Event-Based (✅ What We Built)
```
🧹 Workspace cleaned
🎯 TooLoo Mode activated
✅ Budget system working
🔀 Trying event-based timeline
```
**Signal, meaningful, easy to navigate**

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

**Good Milestone Names:**
- "Feature X working"
- "Before trying approach Y"
- "Cleaned up Z"
- "Milestone: Partnership workflow established"

**Bad Milestone Names:**
- "Update"
- "Changes"
- "Work"
- "Stuff"

**When to Mark:**
- After accomplishing something
- Before experimenting
- At natural stopping points
- When you'd want to "go back to this"

---

## 🎨 DAW Analogy

**Like music production:**
- **Verse 1 done** = Milestone
- **Before trying different chorus** = Milestone
- **Mix sounds good** = Milestone
- **Final master** = Milestone

**NOT like:**
- Auto-save every 30 seconds
- Every knob adjustment
- Every plugin tweak

---

## 🚀 Start Using It

4. **Enter**

**Then view:**
1. Press **Cmd+Shift+H**
