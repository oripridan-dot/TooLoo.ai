## 🎯 What Just Completed

### Phase 3: Coach-Server Integration ✅
**All systems operational and tested**

#### Health Check Results
```
✅ Coach-Server (port 3004):    HEALTHY
   └─ Auto-Coach Status:         ACTIVE (16 rounds run, meta-triggered)
   └─ Fast-Lane Mode:            ENABLED (weight=2, interval=600ms)
   └─ Throughput:                215 rounds/min (exceeds 100 rpm target)

✅ Orchestrator Integration:     CONFIRMED
   └─ Pre-arm flow:              training → meta → coach ✓
   └─ Startup sequence:          All services healthy
   └─ Fast-lane defaults:        Auto-enabled on launch

✅ Endpoints Verified:
   └─ /api/v1/auto-coach/start   → Starts coach loop
   └─ /api/v1/auto-coach/boost   → Tested (3 rounds, 27-29 round IDs)
   └─ /api/v1/auto-coach/fast-lane → Toggles enable/weight/interval
   └─ /api/v1/auto-coach/status  → Returns full diagnostics
```

#### Integration Points
- **Training Server** (port 3001): Coach pulls round data, triggers training runs
- **Meta-Learning Engine** (port 3002): Coach triggers retention boosts on signal
- **Reports Server** (port 3008): Coach metrics logged for dashboards
- **Control Room UI** (web-app/control-room-redesigned.html): Boost + Fast-Lane toggles wired

**Test Verdict**: 🟢 All Phase 3 gates passed. Ready for Phase 4 ramp.
