## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If servers stop responding:
```bash
bash stop-tooloo.sh
bash start-in-codespaces.sh
```

### If you can't access the browser:
1. Check that ports are forwarded in Codespaces
2. Click the "Ports" tab in VS Code
3. Make sure ports 3001 and 5173 are public

### If write permissions fail:
```bash
chmod -R 755 personal-projects data logs
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Open the web interface** (already opened for you!)
2. **Try creating a project**: Type "create project TestApp"
3. **Generate some code**: Ask TooLoo to build something
4. **Explore your files**: Use "list files" to see what's created
5. **Have fun building!** TooLoo can create entire applications

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always use the web interface URL** - It's easier than the API directly
2. **Be specific in your requests** - "Create a React todo app with CSS" works better than "make an app"
3. **Check personal-projects/** - All your generated code is saved there
4. **Use self-awareness commands** - TooLoo can modify itself!
5. **Ask for help** - "What can you do?" or "Show me examples"
