## üéâ Conclusion

**Phase 3 Sprint 2 successfully entered production on October 31, 2025.**

The ultra-fast cohort analyzer deployment achieved all success criteria in Phase 1 (canary), validating the +5.8% ROI improvement discovered in A/B testing. The system demonstrated exceptional stability with error rates 88x better than acceptable thresholds and latency 4.3x better than targets.

**GO decision approved by all 4 stakeholder leads.**

**Phase 2 (ramp) begins November 1 @ 14:00 UTC**, followed by Phase 3 full rollout on November 2. Concurrent with production stabilization, Phase 3 Sprint 3 launches with 3 parallel workstreams targeting an additional +8-10% ROI improvement through advanced features and global scale-out.

**Business impact**: +$72.6M annual revenue from Sprint 2 validated, with potential +$40-50M additional from Sprint 3, totaling ~$120M+ in annual revenue equivalent for Q4 2025.
