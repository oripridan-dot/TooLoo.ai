# 🚀 Future Obstacles Prevention Checklist

**Purpose:** Identify and mitigate potential issues BEFORE they happen during beta launch (Oct 21 - Nov 15)

**Status:** Created October 19, 2025 | Ready for Oct 21 implementation

---

## CRITICAL PATH BLOCKERS (Fix These Before Oct 21)

### 1. Demo Frictionlessness Test
**Obstacle:** Users can't figure out how to use the tool → bounce immediately → wasted acquisition spend  
**Prevention:**
- [ ] Test signup/onboarding flow on mobile (not just desktop)
  * Target: <2 minutes from landing page to first analysis result
  * Test on: iPhone, Android, Chrome, Safari, Firefox
  * Metrics: Count clicks, time spent, where users drop off
- [ ] Create walkthrough video (90 seconds max)
  * Location: Homepage, or first-time user overlay
  * Show: Upload conversation → Run analysis → See results
- [ ] Add example conversation users can try before uploading their own
  * "Try Demo" button → Pre-loaded example → Instant results
  * This proves the tool works without requiring user input
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness audit (all dashboards scale properly)
  * [ ] Control Room home
  * [ ] Analysis dashboard
  * [ ] Results display

**Why:** If users can't understand in 2 min, they leave. Dead acquisition channel.

---

### 2. Provider API Reliability Under Load
**Obstacle:** Claude/OpenAI API rate limited or fails → users see errors → bad first impression  
**Prevention:**
- [ ] Check provider rate limits vs. expected load (1K concurrent users)
  * Claude max: ~2,000 req/min on API tier (verify current limits)
  * OpenAI: Varies by tier/model
  * What you need: 400-1K daily active × ~3 analyses per user = 1,200-3,000 req/day
  * [ ] Confirm you're within limits (you likely are for beta scale)
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff + retry logic
  * If API fails, retry with 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s delays
  * Don't fail user immediately; try 3 times first
- [ ] Set up fallback provider
  * If Claude fails, try OpenAI
  * If OpenAI fails, try Gemini
  * Graceful degradation, not hard failure
- [ ] Add provider monitoring
  * Check provider status dashboard every 4 hours
  * Alert if any provider down/degraded
- [ ] Budget monitoring
  * Track API costs daily (Claude/OpenAI might bill you)
  * Alert if spending looks wrong
  * Implement per-user rate limit (e.g., max 10 analyses/day during beta)

**Why:** API failing = product broken = users get frustrated, post negative reviews

---

### 3. Database Query Performance
**Obstacle:** App slows down when storing/retrieving conversations → timeout errors  
**Prevention:**
- [ ] Database queries audit (what db are you using?)
  * If using JSON file storage: OK for <1K users, starts struggling at 5K
  * If using PostgreSQL/MongoDB: Add indexes on query-heavy fields
  * Estimated records during beta: 1K users × 10 analyses = 10K-50K records
- [ ] Add query timeouts
  * Retrieve conversation: <500ms
  * Store new conversation: <1000ms
  * Search conversations: <2000ms
  * Kill queries that exceed these
- [ ] Implement pagination
  * Don't load all user conversations at once
  * Load 10-20 at a time, paginate if needed
- [ ] Cache recently accessed conversations (if applicable)
  * Reduce database hits for popular analyses

**Why:** Slow database = slow app = poor UX = users churn

---

### 4. Error Handling & User Feedback
**Obstacle:** Tool crashes silently → user doesn't know what happened → confusion/support spam  
**Prevention:**
- [ ] Add error boundary (React) or try/catch handlers
  * Every API call should have try/catch
  * Every async operation should have error handler
- [ ] Display user-friendly error messages
  * ❌ BAD: "TypeError: Cannot read property 'analysis' of undefined"
  * ✅ GOOD: "Sorry, analysis failed. Try again or contact support."
- [ ] Log all errors to backend
  * Track: error message, stack trace, user ID, timestamp
  * Create error dashboard to see what's breaking
- [ ] Create feedback/bug report form
  * Simple form: "What happened?" + "Contact me?"
  * Logs error context automatically
  * Easy one-click access from error messages
- [ ] Implement error rate monitoring
  * Goal: <0.1% error rate
  * Alert if exceeds 0.5% (something's broken)

**Why:** Users can't help you fix issues if they don't know they're happening

---

### 5. Session/Authentication Management
**Obstacle:** Sessions expire mid-analysis → user loses progress → frustration  
**Prevention:**
- [ ] Check: How are users identified? (Session? Token? Cookie?)
  * If none: Implement simple session system (even just session ID in localStorage)
- [ ] Set reasonable timeouts
  * Session timeout: 24 hours during beta (generous, for testers)
  * Inactivity timeout: Warn at 20 min, log out at 30 min
- [ ] Handle session expiration gracefully
  * Don't just error out
  * Save draft conversation
  * Tell user: "Your session expired, but we saved your work"
- [ ] Test on multiple devices
  * Can user log in on phone, then desktop?
  * Can they use multiple tabs?

**Why:** Lost progress = lost user. Sessions are table-stakes.

---

## HIGH-IMPACT SCALING ISSUES (Implement Before Scaling Beyond 1K Users)

### 6. Data Deletion Automation (GDPR/Privacy)
**Obstacle:** Privacy policy says delete data on request → manual process → compliance nightmare  
**Prevention:**
- [ ] Create data deletion endpoint
  * User requests deletion → Find all their conversations/data → Delete → Confirm
  * Should take <5 seconds to execute
- [ ] Create scheduled deletion (post-beta)
  * After Nov 15: Run job to delete all beta data
  * Keep: Error logs, anonymized metrics, legal holds
  * Script should be automated (not manual)
- [ ] Add audit logging
  * Log all deletion requests with timestamps
  * Proof for regulators if needed
- [ ] Test deletion
  * Delete user data → Verify it's gone
  * Run 3x with different users to confirm

**Why:** If regulator asks "show me your deletion process", you need to have one

---

### 7. Incident Response Procedure
**Obstacle:** Tool breaks during peak hours → users can't reach you → chaos  
**Prevention:**
- [ ] Create runbook: "Tool is down, what do I do?"
  * Step 1: Check if it's infra (restart services)
  * Step 2: Check if it's provider (are Claude/OpenAI down?)
  * Step 3: Check if it's code (check recent deploys)
  * Step 4: Communicate to users (post on Reddit/HN if needed)
  * Step 5: Fix or rollback
  * Total time: Assess in <5 min, fix/communicate in <10 min
- [ ] Communication template
  * "Known Issue: Analysis is slow. We're investigating. ETA: 30 min fix"
  * Honest + timely = users stay patient
- [ ] Create status dashboard (even simple one)
  * Show system status (🟢 All good / 🟡 Degraded / 🔴 Down)
  * Last updated timestamp
  * Link to incident details
- [ ] Alert system
  * If service down → Get notified immediately
  * Use Uptime Robot (free tier) or similar

**Why:** First thing users will look for when tool is broken is "are you aware?" Tell them.

---

### 8. Monitoring & Alerting (Beyond Bash Scripts)
**Obstacle:** Bash health check misses subtle issues → Problems compound before you notice  
**Prevention:**
- [ ] Upgrade from bash script to lightweight monitoring
  * Current: `/tmp/daily-monitor.sh` (good baseline)
  * Next: Add real-time alerting on error rate spike
  * Tool: Uptime Robot (free), Sentry (free tier), or DIY with simple Node monitoring
- [ ] Metrics to track
  * Response time (API endpoints): <2s target
  * Error rate: <0.1% target (alert if >0.5%)
  * Uptime: >99.5% target
  * Provider API response time: <5s target
  * Database query time: <1s target
  * User signup rate: Expect 100-500/week during launch blitz
- [ ] Create daily metrics report
  * Email yourself each morning
  * Key metrics + exceptions
  * Takes 2 min to glance
- [ ] Set up alerts (pagerduty-style, even if just emails)
  * Alert when error rate exceeds threshold
  * Alert when response time >3s
  * Alert when provider returns errors

**Why:** You can't fix what you don't see. Automate visibility.

---

### 9. Referral System Implementation
**Obstacle:** Playbook says "referral system is critical" → You didn't build it → Can't scale beyond initial cohort  
**Prevention:**
- [ ] Referral mechanics (decide before launch)
  * User gets unique code: `tooloo-abc123xyz`
  * They share it: "Try TooLoo with code tooloo-abc123xyz"
  * Friend uses code: Gets early adopter status or special feature
  * Original user: Gets notification "You referred 1 person" + maybe bonus analyses
- [ ] Tracking system
  * Store: referral code, who created it, who used it, timestamp
  * Simple table: `referrals` with columns: code, creator_id, user_id, created_at, redeemed_at
- [ ] Leaderboard (optional but powerful)
  * "Top Referrers" (top 5-10)
  * Show: Name, # referred, rank
  * Creates friendly competition → more shares
- [ ] Incentive clarity
  * "Refer a friend → Both of you get: [benefit]"
  * Be specific (don't say "rewards", say "10 free analyses" or "early adopter badge")
- [ ] A/B test messaging
  * Version A: "Refer and both get benefits"
  * Version B: "Refer and you get priority support"
  * See which drives more shares

**Why:** Without referrals, you cap out at acquisition channel reach. With referrals, it compounds.

---

### 10. API Documentation for Testers
**Obstacle:** Advanced testers want to integrate/automate → No docs → They leave  
**Prevention:**
- [ ] Create simple API docs (even if basic)
  * What endpoints exist
  * What parameters they accept
  * What they return
  * Example requests/responses
- [ ] Rate limiting info
  * "Max 10 analyses per user per day during beta"
  * "Max 100 concurrent connections"
- [ ] Error codes & meanings
  * 400: Bad request (explain what was wrong)
  * 429: Rate limited (tell them when they can retry)
  * 500: Server error (temporary, retry later)
  * 503: Service unavailable (maintenance)
- [ ] Webhook option (if applicable)
  * "Want notifications when analysis completes? Use our webhook"
  * Powers advanced integrations
- [ ] Docs location
  * `/api/docs` endpoint
  * Or link from main page
  * Include: Base URL, authentication, example code

**Why:** Some testers are technical. Giving them APIs = unlocks advanced use cases = word-of-mouth growth

---

## MEDIUM-IMPACT ISSUES (Nice-to-Have, Implement if Time)

### 11. Analytics Dashboard
**Obstacle:** You don't know what's working → Can't optimize → Wasted effort  
**Prevention:**
- [ ] Core metrics to track
  * Daily active users
  * Analyses per user (engagement)
  * Common errors
  * Where do users drop off? (signup → first analysis → second analysis)
  * Referral rate (# referred by # invited)
- [ ] Implementation
  * Simple: Google Analytics for page views
  * Medium: Log events to backend (open analysis, click button, etc.)
  * Advanced: Dashboards showing trends
- [ ] Daily check-in routine
  * Spend 5 min each morning glancing at numbers
  * Note anomalies: "Wow, error rate jumped 3x yesterday"
- [ ] Post-acquisition analysis
  * Oct 29: Analyze week 1 (400-500 users acquired)
  * Where did they come from? (HN vs Reddit vs Slack?)
  * Which channel had best "stickiness" (came back 2+ times)?
  * Focus next week on best channels

**Why:** Data-driven optimization beats guessing. Small insights = big wins.

---

### 12. Mobile-Specific UX
**Obstacle:** Users open on phone, UI is unusable → They don't convert  
**Prevention:**
- [ ] Test on actual phone (not just browser emulation)
  * [ ] Button sizes: Minimum 44x44px (easy to tap)
  * [ ] Text size: Minimum 16px base (readable without zoom)
  * [ ] Layout: Single column, content stacks vertically
  * [ ] Input fields: Keyboard friendly, don't hide important buttons
  * [ ] Touch targets: 10px gap between buttons (no mis-taps)
- [ ] Common mobile issues to check
  * Does the entire flow work? (signup, upload, analyze, results)
  * Can user scroll to see all content?
  * Can user submit forms with phone keyboard?
  * Does it work with back button?
- [ ] Test with slow 4G connection
  * Some users will be on slow networks
  * Pages should load/render even if slow
  * Show loading states (spinners, progress bars)

**Why:** 40%+ of internet is mobile. If it doesn't work on phone, you lose half your users.

---

### 13. Competitor/Scraping Protection
**Obstacle:** Competitor scrapes your tool → Uses your patterns → Copies your model  
**Prevention:**
- [ ] Basic rate limiting (per IP)
  * Max 100 requests per IP per hour
  * After that: 429 Too Many Requests
- [ ] User agent blocking (optional)
  * Block known scrapers (curl, wget, etc.) if they're not providing user credentials
- [ ] TOS enforcement
  * Include: "Automated access prohibited"
  * If someone violates: Send cease & desist
  * Not legally bulletproof, but discourages casual scraping
- [ ] Monitor for scraping
  * Check logs for suspicious patterns
  * Look for: Same IP, rapid requests, no delays between requests
- [ ] API keys (future, not beta)
  * If you add API access, use keys that can be revoked
  * Track which key made which requests

**Why:** During beta, you can't prevent determined scraping. But basic protections deter casual copycats.

---

### 14. Database Backups & Disaster Recovery
**Obstacle:** Database corrupts or deletes → 6 months of feedback lost → Can't rebuild  
**Prevention:**
- [ ] Automated backups (at least 1x per day)
  * Daily backup at midnight (or off-peak time)
  * Store backup: Different server/location (not same machine)
  * Retention: Keep last 7 days of backups
- [ ] Test restore (monthly)
  * Restore from backup to test database
  * Verify data is intact
  * Document restore time
- [ ] Know your RTO (Recovery Time Objective)
  * "If database fails, we can be back up in X minutes"
  * During beta: 1-4 hours is acceptable
  * Target: <1 hour restore time
- [ ] Know your RPO (Recovery Point Objective)
  * "We can lose up to X minutes of data"
  * During beta: Losing 24 hours of data is acceptable (1 daily backup)
  * If critical: Increase to hourly backups (0 hours lost)

**Why:** You can't get user trust back once you lose their data.

---

### 15. Support/Feedback Escalation
**Obstacle:** 100 support requests arrive → You're overwhelmed → Users wait days  
**Prevention:**
- [ ] Create feedback/bug report form (simple submission)
  * User enters: Email (optional), bug description, error message (auto-captured)
  * You receive: Email notification + dashboard view
- [ ] Triage categories (help you respond faster)
  * 🔴 CRITICAL: Tool completely broken
  * 🟠 HIGH: Feature doesn't work but tool still usable
  * 🟡 MEDIUM: Minor bug, unclear behavior
  * 🟢 LOW: Feature request, documentation issue
- [ ] SLA (Service Level Agreement, even if informal)
  * CRITICAL: Respond within 1 hour, fix within 4 hours
  * HIGH: Respond within 4 hours, fix within 24 hours
  * MEDIUM: Respond within 24 hours
  * LOW: Respond within 48 hours
- [ ] Template responses for common issues
  * "Tool slow?" → "This is normal during high load. We're scaling."
  * "Analysis incorrect?" → "Beta tool. Please report details."
  * "Can I export data?" → "Yes, request deletion to get your data."
- [ ] Public status updates
  * Post fixes/updates on the app or email testers
  * "Fixed: Slow analysis speed (was a provider timeout)"
  * Users feel heard, not abandoned

**Why:** Users forgive bugs if you communicate. Radio silence breaks trust.

---

## COMPLIANCE & LEGAL (Minimum Viable Risk Mitigation)

### 16. GDPR Compliance Roadmap
**Obstacle:** EU user reports you to regulator → You have no process  
**Prevention:**
- [ ] Essential GDPR requirements (beta phase)
  * ✅ Privacy Policy (created)
  * ✅ Terms of Service (created)
  * ✅ Data deletion on request (implement #6)
  * ✅ Data breach notification plan (document below)
  * ✅ Third-party data processing agreements (with AI providers)
- [ ] Data processing agreement (DPA) with providers
  * Claude, OpenAI, etc. likely already have this
  * Verify: Can you use their service for EU users?
  * Get signed DPA if they have one
- [ ] Right to access implementation
  * User requests: "Give me all my data"
  * You provide: JSON export of their conversations
  * Implement after beta, but document now
- [ ] Data breach response
  * If data breach occurs: Notify affected users within 72 hours
  * Include: What happened, what data, what you did to fix
  * (This is rare; mostly preventative)
- [ ] Cookie policy (if using analytics)
  * If using Google Analytics: Disclose in Privacy Policy
  * Offer: "I prefer not to be tracked" option

**Why:** GDPR fines start at €10K, go up to €20M. Prevention is cheap.

---

### 17. Data Breach Notification Plan
**Obstacle:** Conversations get leaked → No plan → Panic response  
**Prevention:**
- [ ] Incident response (steps to take if breach occurs)
  1. Confirm breach is real (check logs)
  2. Assess scope (which data, how many users?)
  3. Stop the leak (disconnect compromised system)
  4. Notify users within 72 hours (if legal requirement met)
  5. Investigate (how did this happen?)
  6. Fix (prevent it again)
- [ ] Communication template (use this if it happens)
  * "On [DATE], we detected unauthorized access to [DATA]"
  * "What happened: [EXPLANATION]"
  * "What we did: [CONTAINMENT]"
  * "What you should do: [ACTIONS FOR USER]"
  * "Questions: [CONTACT]"
- [ ] Security audit (once, before scaling)
  * Hire security person or company to do penetration test
  * Cost: $500-$5K (worth it for peace of mind)
  * Not needed before Oct 21 launch (POC is low-risk)

**Why:** When it happens (not if), you're prepared. Preparation = less damage.
