## 🔴 Critical Issue

**What:** `/api/v1/system/priority/chat` returns 404  
**Why:** Called during orchestrator startup before web-server fully initialized  
**Fix:** Add retry logic (5 retries, exponential backoff)  
**Impact:** High - affects startup flows  
**Status:** Needs immediate fix

**Code to fix in `servers/orchestrator.js` line 132:**
```javascript
// Current (broken):
await fetch(`http://127.0.0.1:${process.env.WEB_PORT||3000}/api/v1/system/priority/chat`, 
  { method:'POST' });

// Fixed (with retry):
let retries = 0;
while (retries < 5) {
  try {
    await fetch(`http://127.0.0.1:${process.env.WEB_PORT||3000}/api/v1/system/priority/chat`, 
      { method:'POST', timeout: 2000 });
    console.log('✓ Priority mode applied');
    break;
  } catch (e) {
    retries++;
    if (retries < 5) await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 500 * Math.pow(2, retries)));
    else console.warn('⚠️  Priority mode unavailable (non-fatal)');
  }
}
```

Takes 30 seconds, shows coverage status.

### "How do I see what's missing?"
```bash
npm run qa:gaps
```
Shows top gaps by service and priority.

### "How do I test a specific service?"
Each service gets its own test file:
