## Decision: ADVANCE TO RAMP PHASE


✅ **GO DECISION**: All success criteria met. Recommend proceeding to ramp phase.

### Rationale
- Error rate significantly below threshold (0.079% < 1%)
- Latency performance excellent (46ms consistently)
- Availability exceeds SLA requirements (99.97% > 99.9%)
- No business impact detected
- Ultra-fast analyzer performing as validated in testing

### Next Steps
1. Advance to ramp phase (Nov 1 @ 14:00 UTC)
2. Increase traffic to 10% (50,000 learners)
3. Monitor for 4 hours with same thresholds
4. Auto-advance to full rollout if ramp succeeds
