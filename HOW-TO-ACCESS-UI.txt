🚨 YOU'RE SEEING THE WHITE SCREEN BECAUSE YOU'RE ACCESSING THE WRONG URL!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

❌ WRONG: Clicking globe icon that leads to GitHub auth page
   (You'll see: "Not Found" or "404" error)

✅ CORRECT: Access the VITE dev server directly

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📋 STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:

1. In VS Code, look at the BOTTOM PANEL
2. Click the "PORTS" tab
3. You'll see a list of ports like:

   PORT    LABEL         RUNNING ON             VISIBILITY
   3001    API Server    localhost:3001         Public
   5173    Web UI        localhost:5173         Public  ← THIS ONE!

4. Find the row for port 5173
5. In that row, you'll see TWO icons:
   - 🌐 Globe icon (opens forwarded URL) ❌ DON'T CLICK THIS
   - 📋 Copy icon (copies URL) ← OR CLICK THIS

6. INSTEAD: Right-click on port 5173 and select:
   "Open in Browser" or "Preview in Editor"

7. OR manually type in your browser:
   http://localhost:5173

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔍 HOW TO TELL IF YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT PAGE:

✅ CORRECT URL should look like:
   • http://localhost:5173
   • OR: https://<codespace-name>-5173.app.github.dev (forwarded, should work too)

❌ WRONG URL looks like:
   • https://github.dev/pf-signin?id=...
   • Shows "Not Found" or GitHub login page

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎨 WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE (on correct page):

  ✅ Dark purple/pink gradient background
  ✅ "TooLoo.ai" header at top
  ✅ Speaker icon (🔊) in header
  ✅ Chart icon (📊) in header  
  ✅ "Personal Development Assistant" subtitle
  ✅ Chat input box at bottom
  ✅ Glass-effect cards

❌ WHAT YOU'RE SEEING NOW (wrong page):

  ❌ White background
  ❌ "Not Found" text
  ❌ GitHub authentication page
  ❌ No TooLoo.ai interface

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💡 ALTERNATIVE METHOD (if forwarding issues):

1. In VS Code terminal, run:
   npm run dev

2. Look for this output:
   ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
   ➜  Network: http://10.0.11.95:5173/

3. COPY the Network URL (10.0.11.95:5173)

4. In PORTS tab, find port 5173

5. Right-click → "Port Forwarding Visibility" → "Public"

6. Then click the globe icon on port 5173

7. You should see your dark theme UI!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔧 IF STILL NOT WORKING:

Run this in terminal:
  curl http://localhost:5173

If you see HTML with "<div id=\"root\"></div>", the server is working!
The issue is just accessing it through the browser.

Try opening Chrome DevTools (F12) and check the Console tab for errors.
