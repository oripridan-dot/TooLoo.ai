Title: Sleep Extension and Cognitive / Mood Outcomes in Healthy Adults (Paraphrased Open-Access Abstract)

Context: Chronic mild sleep restriction impairs daytime performance. A small controlled intervention explored whether extending time in bed for habitual short sleepers (approx 6 h) improves objective and subjective outcomes over ~2 weeks.

Design (paraphrased):
Participants: 40 healthy adults (20F/20M), age 21–35, habitual sleep < 6.5 h self‑reported.
Baseline Week: Maintain usual schedule; actigraphy + sleep diaries collected.
Intervention Week: Target 8.0–8.5 h time in bed; coaching + nightly reminders.

Measured Variables (original list paraphrased):
- Objective sleep duration (actigraphy)
- Sleep efficiency
- Reaction time (psychomotor vigilance test)
- Working memory accuracy (n‑back task)
- Subjective sleepiness (Karolinska scale)
- Mood / affect balance (PANAS composite)
- Daily caffeine intake (self‑report)
- Morning cortisol (saliva)

Primary Findings (paraphrased):
1. Sleep duration increased ~68 ± 20 minutes (p < 0.001).
2. Reaction time lapses decreased (medium effect size ~0.55).
3. Working memory accuracy improved modestly (small effect size ~0.30).
4. Subjective sleepiness scores improved (lower sleepiness) (p < 0.01).
5. Positive mood increased; negative affect slightly decreased (net affect balance +0.25 SD).
6. No significant change in morning cortisol or caffeine use.

Conclusions (paraphrased): Extending opportunity to sleep for short-sleeping young adults yields measurable gains in vigilance, cognitive efficiency, and mood without physiological stress marker shifts after two weeks.
