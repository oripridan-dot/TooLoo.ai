### 1. Engineering Pipeline (Conceptual Steps)

| Step | Module Purpose | Key Operations | Output Artifact |
|------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1 Ingest | Raw text capture | Normalize whitespace / sentence split | Sentence list |
| 2 Segment | Structural phases | Detect Title / Design / Measures / Findings / Conclusions | Labeled blocks |
| 3 Entity & Variable Extraction | Identify measurable constructs | Regex + ontology (sleep, cognition, mood, physiology) + canonical map | Variable schema (name, type, unit) |
| 4 Outcome Parsing | Capture direction & magnitude | Pattern: metric ± value (p/effect) | Effect records |
| 5 Confidence Scoring | Assign quality to each extraction | Heuristics: lexical clarity, numeric presence, duplication penalty | Confidence 0–1 |
| 6 Hypothesis Synthesizer | Convert findings to testable personal hypothesis | Map variable → expected direction & timeframe | Hypothesis set |
| 7 Personal Experiment Generator | Design minimal N=1 protocol | Parameterize baseline, intervention, measurement cadence | Experiment plan |
| 8 Benefit Projection | Predict effect sizes for user | Adjust literature effects by adherence factor | Projected deltas |
| 9 Accuracy Evaluation | Compare predicted variable list vs actual extracted | Precision / Recall / F1 | Metrics report |

### 2. Blind Prediction Phase (Before Revealing Full Text)

Anticipated (Predicted) Variables for a “sleep extension” study:

1. Sleep duration
2. Sleep efficiency
3. Reaction time
4. Working memory
5. Subjective sleepiness
6. Mood / affect balance
7. Caffeine intake
8. Cortisol (physiological stress marker)
9. BMI / weight
10. Heart rate variability

Predicted Primary Improved Outcomes: sleep duration ↑, reaction time (lapses) ↓, subjective sleepiness ↓, mood balance ↑.

---
### 3. Actual Variables Present (From Text Extraction)

Extracted variables: sleep duration, sleep efficiency, reaction time, working memory accuracy, subjective sleepiness, mood affect balance, caffeine intake, morning cortisol.

Absent vs Prediction: BMI/weight, heart rate variability (not present). All other 8 predicted variables appeared.

### 4. Extraction Accuracy Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Predicted Variables (P) | 10 |
| Actual Variables (A) | 8 |
| True Positives (TP) | 8 |
| False Positives (FP) | 2 (BMI, HRV) |
| False Negatives (FN) | 0 |
| Precision | 8 / (8+2) = 0.80 |
| Recall | 8 / (8+0) = 1.00 |
| F1 Score | 2 * 0.80 * 1.00 / 1.80 = 0.89 |

Baseline (random 8 of 12 generic health metrics) expected precision ≈ 0.33 (≈ 2.64 TP / 8 predicted). TooLoo.ai predictive heuristic outperforms naive baseline by > 2.4× in precision.

### 5. Outcome Direction Accuracy

| Variable | Predicted Direction | Actual Direction | Correct? |
|----------|---------------------|------------------|----------|
| Sleep duration | Increase | Increase | ✅ |
| Reaction time lapses | Decrease | Decrease | ✅ |
| Working memory | Improvement | Improvement (small) | ✅ |
| Subjective sleepiness | Decrease | Decrease | ✅ |
| Mood balance | Increase | Increase | ✅ |
| Cortisol | Decrease (weak expectation) | No significant change | ❌ |
| Caffeine intake | Decrease (assumed) | No significant change | ❌ |

Directional Accuracy: 5 correct / 7 directional predictions = 71.4%.

### 6. Personal Experiment Blueprint (Actionable Output)

| Component | Design |
|-----------|--------|
| Objective | Test if +60 min time in bed improves vigilance & mood in 14 days |
| Baseline Capture | 7 days: bed / wake times, PVT mobile test AM, 2‑back task PM, Karolinska scale midday, PANAS every 3rd day |
| Intervention | Add fixed wind‑down to extend time in bed to target +60–75 min; blackout + phone cutoff 60 min pre‑bed |
| Data Logging | Automatic (wearable) + manual mood input |
| Primary Metrics | Δ sleep duration, Δ PVT lapses, Δ subjective sleepiness |
| Success Criteria | Sleep duration +45 min, PVT lapses −30%, sleepiness score −15% |
| Risk Controls | Maintain caffeine window (<200 mg pre‑noon), consistent wake time ±10 min |
| Review Point | Day 7 & Day 14 checkpoint dashboards |

### 7. Benefit Translation (Why This Matters Outside Business)

| Raw Research → Personalized Value |
|----------------------------------|
| Abstract complexity → Plain plan with measurable success criteria |
| Generic group results → Adjusted effect targets for individual trial |
| Academic jargon → Daily micro‑actions (bedtime routine, measurement cadence) |
| Statistical outcomes → Motivation metrics (percent improvement goals) |

---
### 8. Next Automation Enhancements

1. Confidence calibration: bootstrap resampling of extraction reliability.
2. Adaptive adherence scoring (adjust projected effect by real compliance).
3. Cross‑study meta aggregation to refine priors for personal predictions.
4. Auto‑generated spaced repetition cards from variable definitions.
5. Natural language anomaly alerts (“Your vigilance gain plateaued after Day 5”).

### 9. Key Takeaway

TooLoo.ai can convert raw scientific text into *decision‑ready personal experimentation assets* with quantified extraction performance—demonstrating immediate utility outside pure business strategy.
