## Design Updates

- Added gradient text effects (purple/blue gradient)

- Warmer color palette
- Friendlier micro-copy throughout
- Conversational error messages
- Enhanced button states with color changes

## Philosophy

TooLoo is designed to be:
- **Friendly, not formal** - like chatting with a helpful friend
- **Action-first** - does things rather than explaining how
- **Encouraging** - positive language and emojis
- **Conversational** - speaks naturally, not robotically

This aligns with the original vision where TooLoo had personality modifiers like:
- 😏 Sarcastic
- 🎉 Enthusiastic  
- 🧘 Zen Master
- 🏴‍☠️ Pirate

The current personality is "enthusiastic buddy" mode - always ready to help and excited to build!
