└─ Is it fundamental issue? → Prepare rollback

DECISION (5-10 min):
├─ Continue: If identified as temporary
├─ Hold: If need to investigate (reduce to 5% traffic)
└─ Abort: If unrecoverable (immediate rollback)
```

### If P99 Latency Exceeds 250ms (Warning)

```
TRIGGER: P99 latency > 250ms for 2+ minutes
STATUS: ⚠️ WARNING

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (0-2 min):
├─ [ ] Ops Lead: Check database performance, cache hit rate
├─ [ ] Engineering Lead: Review algorithm efficiency
├─ [ ] Review query patterns for bottlenecks
└─ [ ] All: Stand by for decision

ASSESSMENT (2-5 min):
├─ Is it temporary congestion? → Continue with monitoring
├─ Is it degradation trend? → Prepare to limit traffic
└─ Is it structural issue? → Prepare rollback

DECISION (5-10 min):
├─ Continue: If spike correlates to peak load
├─ Reduce Traffic: If degradation trend detected
└─ Rollback: If threshold breached for >5 min
```

### If Automatic Rollback Triggered

```
TRIGGER: Any success criterion breached for 3+ minutes
STATUS: 🔴 AUTOMATIC ROLLBACK INITIATED

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (0-1 min):
├─ Load balancer: Revert to 0% new, 100% baseline
├─ Monitoring: Verify traffic successfully reverted
├─ Alerts: Notify all team members
└─ Communications: Brief stakeholders

RECOVERY ACTIONS (1-5 min):
├─ [ ] Verify metrics return to baseline
├─ [ ] Assess learner impact (should be zero)
├─ [ ] Begin root cause investigation
├─ [ ] Create incident report

NEXT STEPS (5-30 min):
├─ [ ] Team debrief on what happened
├─ [ ] Identify root cause
├─ [ ] Plan remediation (fix or redesign)
├─ [ ] Reschedule ramp for Nov 3 or later
└─ [ ] Communications to leadership

OUTCOME:
├─ Zero learner disruption (automatic fallback)
├─ Immediate containment (no escalation)
└─ Learning from incident (improved robustness)
