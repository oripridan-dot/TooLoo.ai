```
**Expected:** Purple gradient background, white input box, empty tabs

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Paste Test Prompt
Copy this low-quality prompt:
```
Please tell me how to get better at coding. I really think it's very important 
to learn more stuff about programming because it's good for your career. Can 
you show me some ways to do this? I want to understand more about the different 
languages and frameworks and how they work. It would be nice if you could help 
me with this because I'm not sure where to start. Thanks.
```

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Test Comparison Tab
- [ ] Click "Before & After"
- [ ] Original prompt on left
- [ ] Refined version on right
- [ ] Refinements applied
- [ ] Can copy refined prompt to clipboard

---

## Test B: High Quality Prompt (2 minutes)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clear Input
Click "Clear" button or select all and delete

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Paste High Quality Prompt
```
Create a comprehensive guide on prompt engineering for AI models, including:
(1) Structure principles with examples, (2) Specificity techniques, 
(3) Context window optimization strategies, (4) Refinement workflows.
Success criteria: users can write production-grade prompts achieving 85%+ 
first-pass satisfaction without refinement cycles.
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Analyze

**Expected:**
- [ ] Quality Score: 8.5+/10 (high quality)
- [ ] Fewer refinement suggestions (or none)
- [ ] Most categories show 0 issues
- [ ] Gauge needle points to "Good" zone (7+)
- [ ] Message: "Your prompt is well-structured"

---

## Test C: API Direct Testing (Optional)

### Gauge Test
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3010/api/v1/infographics/generate \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "type": "gauge",
    "data": {"label":"Test","value":7.5,"max":10}
  }'
```
**Expected:** JSON with SVG embedded (801 character SVG)

### Templates Test
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3010/api/v1/infographics/templates
```
**Expected:** Array of 8 templates (gauge, matrix, tree, flow, timeline, network, heatmap, sankey)

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Infographic generated but SVG not available"
- Check browser console (F12)
- Verify infographics server is running: `curl http://localhost:3010/api/v1/infographics/templates`
- Restart server if needed

### Problem: Gauge not auto-generating
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify CORS not blocking request
- Try clicking "Gauge" button manually
- Check infographics server logs: `tail -f /tmp/infographics.log`

### Problem: "Analysis error"
- Refresh page (F5)
- Check console for JavaScript errors
- Verify refinery-engine.js loaded: `console.log(window.RefineryEngine)`

### Problem: No grouped issues showing
- Verify refinery engine has new methods:
  - `console.log(new window.RefineryEngine().groupRefinementsByCategory.toString().substring(0, 50))`
- Should show method definition (not undefined)

## üìä Expected Console Output

When page loads, you should see:
```
‚úÖ Scanner initialized successfully
‚úÖ RefineryEngine instantiated
‚úÖ PromptAnalyzer ready
‚úÖ AnalysisScanner ready
```

When analysis completes:
